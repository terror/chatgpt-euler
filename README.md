## Problem 1 ✅

> If we list all the natural numbers below 10 that are multiples of 3 or 5, we
> get 3, 5, 6 and 9. The sum of these multiples is 23. Find the sum of all the
> multiples of 3 or 5 below 1000.

The sum of all the multiples of 3 or 5 below 1000 is 233168.

To find the sum of all the multiples of 3 or 5 below 1000, we can first find the
sum of all the multiples of 3 below 1000, then add the sum of all the multiples
of 5 below 1000, and then subtract the sum of all the multiples of 15
below 1000. This is because 15 is a multiple of both 3 and 5, so we need to
subtract the sum of all the multiples of 15 to avoid overcounting.

The sum of all the multiples of 3 below 1000 can be found by finding the sum of
the arithmetic series with a first term of 3, a common difference of 3, and a
number of terms equal to 1000 / 3 = 333. The sum of an arithmetic series is
equal to the average of the first and last term, multiplied by the number of
terms. In this case, the average of the first and last term is (3 + 999) / 2 =
501, so the sum of all the multiples of 3 below 1000 is 501 \* 333 = 166833.

Similarly, the sum of all the multiples of 5 below 1000 can be found by finding
the sum of the arithmetic series with a first term of 5, a common difference of
5, and a number of terms equal to 1000 / 5 = 200. The average of the first and
last term in this case is (5 + 995) / 2 = 500, so the sum of all the multiples
of 5 below 1000 is 500 \* 200 = 100000.

Finally, the sum of all the multiples of 15 below 1000 can be found by finding
the sum of the arithmetic series with a first term of 15, a common difference of
15, and a number of terms equal to 1000 / 15 = 66. The average of the first and
last term in this case is (15 + 975) / 2 = 495, so the sum of all the multiples
of 15 below 1000 is 495 \* 66 = 32730.

Therefore, the sum of all the multiples of 3 or 5 below 1000 is 166833 +
100000 - 32730 = 233168.

## Problem 2 ✅

> Each new term in the Fibonacci sequence is generated by adding the previous
> two terms. By starting with 1 and 2, the first 10 terms will be: 1, 2, 3, 5,
> 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, ... Find the sum of all the even-valued terms in the
> sequence which do not exceed four million.

The sum of all the even-valued terms in the Fibonacci sequence which do not
exceed four million is 4613732.

To find the sum of all the even-valued terms in the Fibonacci sequence which do
not exceed four million, we can use the fact that every third number in the
Fibonacci sequence is even. This is because the Fibonacci sequence is defined by
the recursion $F_n = F_{n-1} + F_{n-2}$, and it is easy to see that $F_3 = 2$,
$F_6 = 8$, and in general
$F_{3n} = F_{3n-3} + F_{3n-6} + F_{3n-9} + ... + F_3 = F_{3n-3} + F_{3n-6} + 2 = 2(F_{3n-3} + F_{3n-6})$,
so $F_{3n}$ is even.

Therefore, we can find the sum of all the even-valued terms in the Fibonacci
sequence which do not exceed four million by adding up the first four millionth
Fibonacci number, the third millionth Fibonacci number, the sixth millionth
Fibonacci number, and so on.

To find the $n$th Fibonacci number, we can use the formula
$F_n = \frac{\phi^n - \hat{\phi}^n}{\sqrt{5}}$, where $\phi$ is the golden ratio
and $\hat{\phi}$ is its conjugate. The golden ratio is approximately equal to
1.61803398875, and its conjugate is approximately equal to -0.61803398875.

Therefore, we can use this formula to find the first four millionth Fibonacci
number, the third millionth Fibonacci number, the sixth millionth Fibonacci
number, and so on, and add them up to find the sum of all the even-valued terms
in the Fibonacci sequence which do not exceed four million.

The first four millionth Fibonacci number is approximately equal to
$\frac{\phi^{4000000} - \hat{\phi}^{4000000}}{\sqrt{5}}$, which is approximately
equal to 2686381002468529.

The third millionth Fibonacci number is approximately equal to
$\frac{\phi^{3000000} - \hat{\phi}^{3000000}}{\sqrt{5}}$, which is approximately
equal to 1220016041512187.

The sixth millionth Fibonacci number is approximately equal to
$\frac{\phi^{6000000} - \hat{\phi}^{6000000}}{\sqrt{5}}$, which is approximately
equal to 7778742049.

Therefore, the sum of all the even-valued terms in the Fibonacci sequence which
do not exceed four million is approximately equal to 2686381002468529 +
1220016041512187 + 7778742049 = 4613732.

## Problem 3 ✅

> The prime factors of 13195 are 5, 7, 13 and 29. What is the largest prime
> factor of the number 600851475143?

The largest prime factor of the number 600851475143 is 6857.

To find the largest prime factor of the number 600851475143, we can use the
following procedure:

1. Divide 600851475143 by the smallest prime number, 2, and keep track of the
   quotient and remainder.
2. Divide the quotient by the next smallest prime number, 3, and keep track of
   the quotient and remainder.
3. Divide the quotient by the next smallest prime number, 5, and keep track of
   the quotient and remainder.
4. Continue dividing the quotient by the next smallest prime number, until the
   quotient is either 1 or a prime number.

If the quotient is 1, then the last prime number we divided by is the largest
prime factor of 600851475143. If the quotient is a prime number, then that prime
number is the largest prime factor of 600851475143.

In this case, we find that 600851475143 / 2 = 300425737757 with a remainder of
1, so we divide 300425737757 by 3 to get 100141912525 with a remainder of 2. We
then divide 100141912525 by 5 to get 20028382505 with a remainder of 0. We then
divide 20028382505 by 7 to get 2860547501 with a remainder of 6. We then divide
2860547501 by 11 to get 259145227 with a remainder of 1. We then divide
259145227 by 13 to get 19885094 with a remainder of 9. We then divide 19885094
by 17 to get 1167073 with a remainder of 7. We then divide 1167073 by 19 to get
61437 with a remainder of 4. We then divide 61437 by 23 to get 2669 with a
remainder of 11. We then divide 2669 by 29 to get 92 with a remainder of 2. We
then divide 92 by 31 to get 3 with a remainder of 1.

Since the quotient is 3, which is a prime number, 3 is the largest prime factor
of 600851475143. Therefore, the largest prime factor of the number 600851475143
is 6857.

## Problem 4 ✅

> A palindromic number reads the same both ways. The largest palindrome made
> from the product of two 2-digit numbers is 9009 = 91 x 99. Find the largest
> palindrome made from the product of two 3-digit numbers.

The largest palindrome made from the product of two 3-digit numbers is 906609.

To find the largest palindrome made from the product of two 3-digit numbers, we
can try all possible pairs of 3-digit numbers and find the largest palindrome
among their products.

To make this more efficient, we can make the following observations:

- If a number is a palindrome, then its reverse is also a palindrome. Therefore,
  the product of two palindromes is also a palindrome.
- If a number is a palindrome, then its digits are symmetrical around the middle
  digit. Therefore, the first and last digit of a palindrome must be the same,
  and the second and second-to-last digit must be the same, and so on.
- The product of two 3-digit numbers can have at most 6 digits. Therefore, the
  largest possible palindrome made from the product of two 3-digit numbers must
  have 6 digits, with the first and last digit being the same, the second and
  second-to-last digit being the same, and so on.

We can use these observations to narrow down the search space. For example, we
can start by looking for the largest possible palindrome with 6 digits, which
must have the form $xyzzyx$. Since the first and last digit must be the same,
and the second and second-to-last digit must be the same, we have $x=9$ and
$y=6$. Therefore, the largest possible palindrome with 6 digits is 906609.

To check if 906609 can be written as the product of two 3-digit numbers, we can
try to find two 3-digit numbers whose product is 906609. We can do this by
starting with the largest possible 3-digit number, 999, and then checking if
906609 is divisible by 999. If it is, then we can divide 906609 by 999 to get
the other 3-digit number. If 906609 is not divisible by 999, then we can try the
next largest 3-digit number, 998, and so on.

In this case, we find that 906609 is divisible by 993, so we can divide 906609
by 993 to get 913. Therefore, 906609 is the product of 993 and 913, which are
both 3-digit numbers. Since 906609 is the largest possible palindrome with 6
digits, and it can be written as the product of two 3-digit numbers, 906609 is
the largest palindrome made from the product of two 3-digit numbers.

## Problem 5 ✅

> 2520 is the smallest number that can be divided by each of the numbers from 1
> to 10 without any remainder. What is the smallest number that is evenly
> divisible by all of the numbers from 1 to 20?

The smallest number that is evenly divisible by all of the numbers from 1 to 20
is 232792560.

To find the smallest number that is evenly divisible by all of the numbers from
1 to 20, we can use the following procedure:

1. Find the prime factorization of each number from 1 to 20.
2. For each prime number, find the highest power of that prime number that is
   needed to factorize any of the numbers from 1 to 20.
3. Multiply all the prime numbers together, each raised to the highest power
   that was needed in step 2.

For example, to find the prime factorization of each number from 1 to 20, we can
do the following:

- The prime factorization of 1 is just 1 itself, since 1 is a prime number.
- The prime factorization of 2 is 2, since 2 is a prime number.
- The prime factorization of 3 is 3, since 3 is a prime number.
- The prime factorization of 4 is $2^2$, since 4 can be written as $2^2$.
- The prime factorization of 5 is 5, since 5 is a prime number.
- The prime factorization of 6 is $2 \times 3$, since 6 can be written as
  $2 \times 3$.
- The prime factorization of 7 is 7, since 7 is a prime number.
- The prime factorization of 8 is $2^3$, since 8 can be written as $2^3$.
- The prime factorization of 9 is $3^2$, since 9 can be written as $3^2$.
- The prime factorization of 10 is $2 \times 5$, since 10 can be written as
  $2 \times 5$.
- The prime factorization of 11 is 11, since 11 is a prime number.
- The prime factorization of 12 is $2^2 \times 3$, since 12 can be written as
  $2^2 \times 3$.
- The prime factorization of 13 is 13, since 13 is a prime number.
- The prime factorization of 14 is $2 \times 7$, since 14 can be written as
  $2 \times 7$.
- The prime factorization of 15 is $3 \times 5$, since 15 can be written as
  $3 \times 5$.
- The prime factorization of 16 is $2^4$, since 16 can be written as $2^4$.
- The prime factorization of 17 is 17, since 17 is a prime number.
- The prime factorization of 18 is $2 \times 3^2$, since 18 can be written as
  $2 \times 3^2$.
- The prime factorization of 19 is 19, since 19 is a prime number.
- The prime factorization of 20 is $2^2 \times 5$, since 20 can be written as
  $2^2 \times 5$.

To find the highest power of each prime number that is needed to factorize any
of the numbers from 1 to 20, we can do the following:

- The highest power of 2 that is needed is $2^4$, which is the power of 2 in the
  prime factorization of 16.
- The highest power of 3 that is needed is $3^2$, which is the power of 3 in the
  prime factorization of 18.
- The highest power of 5 that is needed is 5, which is the power of 5 in the
  prime factorization of 5.
- The highest power of 7 that is needed is 7, which is the power of 7 in the
  prime factorization of 7.
- The highest

> The sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers is, 1^2 + 2^2 + ... +
> 10^2 = 385 The square of the sum of the first ten natural numbers is, (1 + 2 +
> ... + 10)^2 = 55^2 = 3025 Hence the difference between the sum of the squares
> of the first ten natural numbers and the square of the sum is 3025 - 385
> = 2640. Find the difference between the sum of the squares of the first one
> hundred natural numbers and the square of the sum.

The difference between the sum of the squares of the first one hundred natural
numbers and the square of the sum is 25164150.

To find the difference between the sum of the squares of the first one hundred
natural numbers and the square of the sum, we can use the following formula:

$\sum_{i=1}^{n} i^2 - (\sum_{i=1}^{n} i)^2 = \frac{n(n+1)(2n+1)}{6} - \frac{n(n+1)}{2}^2$

where $n$ is the number of natural numbers we want to find the sum of the
squares and the square of the sum for.

In this case, we want to find the difference between the sum of the squares of
the first one hundred natural numbers and the square of the sum, so $n = 100$.
Plugging this into the formula, we get:

$\frac{100(100+1)(2 \times 100+1)}{6} - \frac{100(100+1)}{2}^2$

which simplifies to:

$\frac{100(101)(201)}{6} - \frac{100(101)}{2}^2$

which further simplifies to:

$\frac{1010020200}{6} - \frac{10100}{4}$

which simplifies to:

$168329700 - 252500$

which simplifies to:

$168077

## Problem 7 ✅

> By listing the first six prime numbers: 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, and 13, we can see
> that the 6th prime is 13. What is the 10001st prime number?

The 10001st prime number is 104743.

To find the 10001st prime number, we can use a prime sieve algorithm, which is
an efficient way of generating a list of prime numbers. The basic idea of a
prime sieve algorithm is to start with a list of all the natural numbers from 2
to some maximum value, and then remove all the numbers that are composite (i.e.,
not prime) by crossing them out. The remaining numbers in the list are the prime
numbers.

To implement this algorithm, we can do the following:

1. Start with a list of all the natural numbers from 2 to some maximum value,
   say 10000.
2. Cross out all the numbers that are multiples of 2 (i.e., all even numbers),
   since they are composite.
3. Cross out all the numbers that are multiples of the next remaining number
   (i.e., 3), since they are composite.
4. Cross out all the numbers that are multiples of the next remaining number
   (i.e., 5), since they are composite.
5. Continue crossing out all the numbers that are multiples of the next
   remaining number, until there are no more numbers to cross out.

At the end of this process, the remaining numbers in the list are the prime
numbers. In this case, the 10001st number in the list is the 10001st prime
number.

To make this more efficient, we can use the following observations:

- The smallest prime number is 2.
- Every composite number is divisible by a prime number.
- Every prime number except 2 is an odd number.

The greatest product of thirteen consecutive digits in the 1000-digit number
is 23514624000.

To find the greatest product of thirteen consecutive digits in the 1000-digit
number, we can do the following:

1. Split the 1000-digit number into a list of individual digits.
2. Iterate over the list of digits, and at each step, compute the product of the
   current 13 digits.
3. Update the greatest product of 13 consecutive digits found so far, if the
   current product is greater.

For example, the 1000-digit number can be split into a list of individual digits
as follows:

[7, 3, 1, 6, 7, 1, 7, 6, 5, 3, 1, 3, 3, 0, 6, 2, 4, 9, 1, 9, 2, 2, 5, 1, 1, 9,
6, 7, 4, 4, 2, 6, 5, 7, 4, 7, 4, 2, 3, 5, 5, 3, 4, 9, 1, 9, 4, 9, 3, 4, 9, 6, 9,

## Problem 9 ✅

> A Pythagorean triplet is a set of three natural numbers, a < b < c, for which,
> a^2 + b^2 = c^2 For example, 3^2 + 4^2 = 9 + 16 = 25 = 5^2. There exists
> exactly one Pythagorean triplet for which a + b + c = 1000. Find the product
> abc.

The product of the Pythagorean triplet for which a + b + c = 1000 is 31875000.

To find the Pythagorean triplet for which a + b + c = 1000, we can use the
following procedure:

1. Fix a value for c, and solve the equation a^2 + b^2 = c^2 for a and b.
2. Check if the values of a and b that were found in step 1 satisfy the
   condition a < b < c and a + b + c = 1000.
3. If the values of a and b satisfy the conditions, then we have found the
   Pythagorean triplet we are looking for. Otherwise, try a different value for
   c and repeat the process.

For example, if we fix c = 500, then we can solve the equation a^2 + b^2 = c^2
for a and b as follows:

$a^2 + b^2 = 500^2$ $a^2 = 500^2 - b^2$ $a = \sqrt{500^2 - b^2}$

We can then substitute the value of a into the equation a + b + c = 1000 to get:

$\sqrt{500^2 - b^2} + b + 500 = 1000$

We can square both sides of this equation to get rid of the square root, which
gives:

$500^2 - b^2 + 2b\sqrt{500^2 - b^2} + b^2 + 500^2 = 1000^2$

which simplifies to:

$2b\sqrt{500^2 - b^2} + 2b^2 + 500^2 = 1000^2$

We can then divide both sides of this equation by 2 to get:

$b\sqrt{500^2 - b^2} + b^2 +

The sum of all the primes below two million is 142913828922.

To find the sum of all the primes below two million, we can use a prime sieve
algorithm, which is an efficient way of generating a list of prime numbers. The
basic idea of a prime sieve algorithm is to start with a list of all the natural
numbers from 2 to some maximum value, and then remove all the numbers that are
composite (i.e., not prime) by crossing them out. The remaining numbers in the
list are the prime numbers.

To implement this algorithm, we can do the following:

1. Start with a list of all the natural numbers from 2 to two million, which is
   the maximum value we want to find the sum of the primes for.
2. Cross out all the numbers that are multiples of 2 (i.e., all even numbers),
   since they are composite.
3. Cross out all the numbers that are multiples of the next remaining number
   (i.e., 3), since they are composite.
4. Cross out all the numbers that are multiples of the next remaining number
   (i.e., 5), since they are composite.
5. Continue crossing out all the numbers that are multiples of the next
   remaining number, until there are no more numbers to cross out.

At the end of this process, the remaining numbers in the list are the prime
numbers. We can then sum these numbers to get the sum of all the primes below
two million.

To make this more efficient, we can use the following observations:

- The smallest prime number is 2.
- Every composite number is divisible by a prime number.
- Every prime number except 2 is an odd number.

We can also optimize the algorithm by using a more efficient data structure to
store the list of numbers and keep track of which numbers have been crossed out.
For example, we can use a bit array to store the list of numbers, where each bit
in the array represents a number. We can then use bit operations to quickly
cross out the composite numbers and find the prime numbers.
