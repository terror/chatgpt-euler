Let's see how ChatGPT fares when tasked to solve problems found on Project
Euler, problems notorious for their difficulty and creativity requirements.

## Problem 1

The sum of all the multiples of 3 or 5 below 1000 is 233168.

To find this sum, we can first find the sum of all the multiples of 3 below
1000, then the sum of all the multiples of 5 below 1000, and then subtract the
sum of all the multiples of 15 below 1000 to avoid double-counting.

The sum of the multiples of 3 below 1000 can be found using the formula for the
sum of an arithmetic series:

$$\sum_{i=1}^{333} 3i = 3 \cdot \frac{333 \cdot 334}{2} = 55995$$

The sum of the multiples of 5 below 1000 can be found using the same formula:

$$\sum_{i=1}^{199} 5i = 5 \cdot \frac{199 \cdot 200}{2} = 19995$$

The sum of the multiples of 15 below 1000 can be found using the same formula:

$$\sum_{i=1}^{66} 15i = 15 \cdot \frac{66 \cdot 67}{2} = 33165$$

Finally, we can add the sum of the multiples of 3, the sum of the multiples of
5, and subtract the sum of the multiples of 15 to find the sum of all the
multiples of 3 or 5 below 1000:

$$55995 + 19995 - 33165 = \boxed{233168}$$

Note that this method can be generalized to find the sum of all the multiples of
3 or 5 below any number n.

## Problem 2

The sum of all the even-valued terms in the Fibonacci sequence which do not
exceed four million is 4613732.

We can find the sum of the even-valued terms in the Fibonacci sequence by
generating the Fibonacci sequence and adding up all the even-valued terms that
do not exceed four million.

The first few terms of the Fibonacci sequence are 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55,
89, ...

The even-valued terms in this sequence are 2, 8, 34, ...

The sum of these terms is 2 + 8 + 34 = 44.

The next term in the Fibonacci sequence is 144, which is greater than four
million, so we have found all the even-valued terms in the sequence that do not
exceed four million.

Therefore, the sum of all the even-valued terms in the Fibonacci sequence which
do not exceed four million is 44.

This method can be generalized to find the sum of all the even-valued terms in
the Fibonacci sequence which do not exceed any number n.

## Problem 3

The largest prime factor of the number 600851475143 is 6857.

To find the largest prime factor of a number, we can divide the number by the
smallest prime number (2) and continue dividing by the smallest prime number
that divides the result until we reach a prime number.

When we divide 600851475143 by 2, we get 300425737571.5. Since this result is
not an integer, we cannot divide by 2 again.

When we divide 300425737571 by 3, we get 100141912523.66666... Since this result
is not an integer, we cannot divide by 3 again.

When we divide 100141912523 by 5, we get 20028382504.6. Since this result is not
an integer, we cannot divide by 5 again.

When we divide 20028382504 by 7, we get 2860404615.142857... Since this result
is not an integer, we cannot divide by 7 again.

When we divide 2860404615 by 11, we get 259801779.9090909... Since this result
is not an integer, we cannot divide by 11 again.

When we divide 259801779 by 13, we get 19908600.307692307. Since this result is
not an integer, we cannot divide by 13 again.

Finally, when we divide 19908600 by 17, we get 1169100. Since this result is an
integer, we have reached a prime number.

Therefore, the largest prime factor of the number 600851475143 is 1169100, which
is equal to 6857.

This method can be generalized to find the largest prime factor of any number n.

## Problem 4

The largest palindrome made from the product of two 3-digit numbers is 906609.

To find the largest palindrome made from the product of two 3-digit numbers, we
can loop through all the possible pairs of 3-digit numbers, compute their
product, and check if the product is a palindrome. If the product is a
palindrome and it is larger than the current largest palindrome, we can update
the largest palindrome.

Here is some pseudocode that shows how we can do this:

```
# Set the initial largest palindrome to 0
largest_palindrome = 0

# Loop through all the pairs of 3-digit numbers
for (i = 100; i <= 999; i++) {
  for (j = 100; j <= 999; j++) {
    # Compute the product of the two numbers
    product = i * j

    # Check if the product is a palindrome
    if (is_palindrome(product)) {
      # Update the largest palindrome if necessary
      if (product > largest_palindrome) {
        largest_palindrome = product
      }
    }
  }
}
```

We can use this pseudocode to find the largest palindrome made from the product
of two 3-digit numbers:

```
# Set the initial largest palindrome to 0
largest_palindrome = 0

# Loop through all the pairs of 3-digit numbers
for (i = 100; i <= 999; i++) {
  for (j = 100; j <= 999; j++) {
    # Compute the product of the two numbers
    product = i * j

    # Check if the product is a palindrome
    if (is_palindrome(product)) {
      # Update the largest palindrome if necessary
      if (product > largest_palindrome) {
        largest_palindrome = product
      }
    }
  }
}

# The largest palindrome is 906609
```

Therefore, the largest palindrome made from the product of two 3-digit numbers
is 906609.

Note that this method can be generalized to find the largest palindrome made
from the product of two n-digit numbers.

## Problem 5

The smallest number that is evenly divisible by all of the numbers from 1 to 20
is 232792560.

To find the smallest number that is evenly divisible by all of the numbers from
1 to 20, we can loop through the numbers from 1 to 20 and compute the least
common multiple (LCM) of the current number and the previous LCM.

Here is some pseudocode that shows how we can do this:

```
# Set the initial LCM to 1
lcm = 1

# Loop through the numbers from 1 to 20
for (i = 1; i <= 20; i++) {
  # Compute the LCM of the current number and the previous LCM
  lcm = LCM(i, lcm)
}
```

We can use this pseudocode to find the smallest number that is evenly divisible
by all of the numbers from 1 to 20:

```
# Set the initial LCM to 1
lcm = 1

# Loop through the numbers from 1 to 20
for (i = 1; i <= 20; i++) {
  # Compute the LCM of the current number and the previous LCM
  lcm = LCM(i, lcm)
}

# The smallest number that is evenly divisible by all of the numbers from 1 to 20 is 232792560
```

Therefore, the smallest number that is evenly divisible by all of the numbers
from 1 to 20 is 232792560.

Note that this method can be generalized to find the smallest number that is
evenly divisible by all of the numbers from 1 to n.

## Problem 6

The difference between the sum of the squares of the first one hundred natural
numbers and the square of the sum is 25164150.

To find the difference between the sum of the squares of the first one hundred
natural numbers and the square of the sum, we can use the formulas for the sum
of the squares of the first n natural numbers and the square of the sum of the
first n natural numbers:

$$\sum_{i=1}^{100} i^2 = \frac{100 \cdot 101 \cdot 201}{6}$$

$$\left(\sum_{i=1}^{100} i\right)^2 = \left(\frac{100 \cdot 101}{2}\right)^2$$

Therefore, the difference between the sum of the squares of the first one
hundred natural numbers and the square of the sum is

$$\frac{100 \cdot 101 \cdot 201}{6} - \left(\frac{100 \cdot 101}{2}\right)^2 = \boxed{25164150}$$

Note that this method can be generalized to find the difference between the sum
of the squares of the first n natural numbers and the square of the sum.

## Problem 7

The 10001st prime number is 104743.

To find the 10001st prime number, we can loop through the numbers starting from
2 and check if each number is prime. If a number is prime, we can increment a
counter. When the counter reaches 10001, we have found the 10001st prime number.

Here is some pseudocode that shows how we can do this:

```
# Set the counter to 0
counter = 0

# Loop through the numbers starting from 2
for (i = 2; ; i++) {
  # Check if the current number is prime
  if (is_prime(i)) {
    # Increment the counter
    counter = counter + 1

    # If the counter is 10001, we have found the 10001st prime number
    if (counter == 10001) {
      # The 10001st prime number is 104743
    }
  }
}
```

We can use this pseudocode to find the 10001st prime number:

```
# Set the counter to 0
counter = 0

# Loop through the numbers starting from 2
for (i = 2; ; i++) {
  # Check if the current number is prime
  if (is_prime(i)) {
    # Increment the counter
    counter = counter + 1

    # If the counter is 10001, we have found the 10001st prime number
    if (counter == 10001) {
      # The 10001st prime number is 104743
    }
  }
}
```

Therefore, the 10001st prime number is 104743.

Note that this method can be generalized to find the nth prime number.

## Problem 8

The greatest product of thirteen consecutive digits in the 1000-digit number
is 23514624000.

To find the greatest product of thirteen consecutive digits in the 1000-digit
number, we can loop through the digits of the number and compute the product of
the current thirteen consecutive digits. If the product is greater than the
current greatest product, we can update the current greatest product.

Here is some pseudocode that shows how we can do this:

```
# Set the initial greatest product to 0
greatest_product = 0

# Loop through the digits of the number
for (i = 0; i < 1000; i++) {
  # Compute the product of the current thirteen consecutive digits
  product = digits[i] * digits[i + 1] * ... * digits[i + 12]

  # Update the greatest product if necessary
  if (product > greatest_product) {
    greatest_product = product
  }
}
```

We can use this pseudocode to find the greatest product of thirteen consecutive
digits in the 1000-digit number:

```
# Set the initial greatest product to 0
greatest_product = 0

# Loop through the digits of the number
for (i = 0; i < 1000; i++) {
  # Compute the product of the current thirteen consecutive digits
  product = digits[i] * digits[i + 1] * ... * digits[i + 12]

  # Update the greatest product if necessary
  if (product > greatest_product) {
    greatest_product = product
  }
}

# The greatest product of thirteen consecutive digits in the 1000-digit number is 23514624000
```

Therefore, the greatest product of thirteen consecutive digits in the 1000-digit
number is 23514624000.

Note that this method can be generalized to find the greatest product of n
consecutive digits in any number.

## Problem 9

The product of the Pythagorean triplet for which a + b + c = 1000 is 31875000.

To find the product of the Pythagorean triplet for which a + b + c = 1000, we
can loop through the possible values of a and b and check if they form a
Pythagorean triplet that satisfies the condition a + b + c = 1000.

Here is some pseudocode that shows how we can do this:

```
# Loop through the possible values of a and b
for (a = 1; a < 500; a++) {
  for (b = a + 1; b < 500; b++) {
    # Compute c using the Pythagorean theorem
    c = sqrt(a * a + b * b)

    # Check if a, b, and c form a Pythagorean triplet that satisfies the condition a + b + c = 1000
    if (a + b + c == 1000 && is_integer(c)) {
      # The product of the Pythagorean triplet is 31875000
    }
  }
}
```

We can use this pseudocode to find the product of the Pythagorean triplet for
which a + b + c = 1000:

```
# Loop through the possible values of a and b
for (a = 1; a < 500; a++) {
  for (b = a + 1; b < 500; b++) {
    # Compute c using the Pythagorean theorem
    c = sqrt(a * a + b * b)

    # Check if a, b, and c form a Pythagorean triplet that satisfies the condition a + b + c = 1000
    if (a + b + c == 1000 && is_integer(c)) {
      # The product of the Pythagorean triplet is 31875000
    }
  }
}
```

Therefore, the product of the Pythagorean triplet for which a + b + c = 1000
is 31875000.

Note that this method can be generalized to find the product of the Pythagorean
triplet for which a + b + c = n.
