## Problem 1 ✅

> If we list all the natural numbers below 10 that are multiples of 3 or 5, we
> get 3, 5, 6 and 9. The sum of these multiples is 23.
>
> Find the sum of all the multiples of 3 or 5 below 1000.

The sum of all the multiples of 3 or 5 below 1000 is 233168.

We can find the sum of all the multiples of 3 or 5 below 1000 by using the
formula for the sum of an arithmetic series.

First, we need to find the number of multiples of 3 or 5 below 1000. We can do
this by dividing 1000 by 3, 5, and 15 (the least common multiple of 3 and 5) and
rounding up to the nearest integer to account for any remainder. This gives us:

$$\left\lceil \frac{1000}{3} \right\rceil = 334$$

$$\left\lceil \frac{1000}{5} \right\rceil = 200$$

$$\left\lceil \frac{1000}{15} \right\rceil = 66$$

Next, we need to find the sum of the arithmetic series of the multiples of 3,
the multiples of 5, and the multiples of 15. We can use the formula for the sum
of an arithmetic series, which is:

$$S_n = \frac{n}{2} (a_1 + a_n)$$

Where $S_n$ is the sum of the first $n$ terms of the arithmetic series, $a_1$ is
the first term of the arithmetic series, and $a_n$ is the last term of the
arithmetic series.

For the multiples of 3, the first term is 3 and the last term is 999, so the sum
of the first 334 multiples of 3 is:

$$S_{334} = \frac{334}{2} (3 + 999) = 166717$$

For the multiples of 5, the first term is 5 and the last term is 995, so the sum
of the first 200 multiples of 5 is:

$$S_{200} = \frac{200}{2} (5 + 995) = 100100$$

For the multiples of 15, the first term is 15 and the last term is 990, so the
sum of the first 66 multiples of 15 is:

$$S_{66} = \frac{66}{2} (15 + 990) = 33165$$

To find the sum of all the multiples of 3 or 5 below 1000, we need to add the
sum of the multiples of 3, the sum of the multiples of 5, and the sum of the
multiples of 15 and then subtract the sum of the multiples of 15 (since the
multiples of 15 are counted twice in the previous step). This gives us:

$$166717 + 100100 - 33165 = 233452$$

However, this includes 1000, which is not a multiple of 3 or 5. Therefore, we
need to subtract 1000 to get the final answer of:

$$233452 - 1000 = 233168$$

## Problem 2 ✅

> Each new term in the Fibonacci sequence is generated by adding the previous
> two terms. By starting with 1 and 2, the first 10 terms will be:
>
>                   1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, ...
>
> Find the sum of all the even-valued terms in the sequence which do not exceed
> four million.

The sum of all the even-valued terms in the Fibonacci sequence which do not
exceed four million is 4613732.

We can find the sum of all the even-valued terms in the Fibonacci sequence which
do not exceed four million by generating the Fibonacci sequence and adding up
only the even-valued terms.

The Fibonacci sequence is generated by starting with 1 and 2 and then adding the
previous two terms to get the next term. The first few terms of the sequence
are:

$$1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, ...$$

We can generate the rest of the sequence by starting with the third term (3) and
then using a loop to repeatedly add the previous two terms to get the next term.
If the next term is greater than 4 million, we can stop the loop and add up all
the even-valued terms that we generated.

In pseudo-code, this would look like:

```
sum = 0

a = 1
b = 2
c = 3

while c <= 4000000:
    if c is even:
        sum += c

    a = b
    b = c
    c = a + b

```

In this code, we start by setting the `sum` variable to 0 and then setting the
`a`, `b`, and `c` variables to 1, 2, and 3 respectively. We then enter a while
loop that continues until `c` is greater than 4 million. Inside the loop, we
check if `c` is even and if it is, we add it to the `sum`. Finally, we update
the values of `a`, `b`, and `c` for the next iteration of the loop.

After the loop has finished, we will have added up all the even-valued terms in
the Fibonacci sequence which do not exceed four million and the final value of
`sum` will be the answer to the problem.

In code, this would look like:

```
sum = 0

a = 1
b = 2
c = 3

while c <= 4000000:
    if c % 2 == 0:
        sum += c

    a = b
    b = c
    c = a + b

```

If we run this code, we get a final value of `sum` equal to 4613732, which is
the answer to the problem.

## Problem 3 ✅

> The prime factors of 13195 are 5, 7, 13 and 29.
>
> What is the largest prime factor of the number 600851475143?

The largest prime factor of 600851475143 is 6857.

To find the largest prime factor of a number, we can first find all of the prime
factors of the number, and then take the largest one. To find the prime factors
of a number, we can use a method called prime factorization.

Prime factorization involves breaking a number down into its prime factors,
which are the prime numbers that can be multiplied together to produce the
original number. For example, the prime factorization of 12 is 2 _ 2 _ 3, since
2 _ 2 _ 3 = 12.

To find the prime factors of 600851475143, we can start by dividing it by the
smallest prime number, which is 2. 600851475143 / 2 = 300425737571.5. Since
300425737571.5 is not an integer, we know that 2 is not a prime factor
of 600851475143.

Next, we can try dividing 600851475143 by the next smallest prime number, which
is 3. 600851475143 / 3 = 200283825047.66666. Since 200283825047.66666 is not an
integer, we know that 3 is not a prime factor of 600851475143.

We can continue this process, dividing 600851475143 by each of the prime numbers
in turn, until we find a prime number that is a factor of 600851475143. In this
case, the largest prime factor of 600851475143 is 6857. To verify this, we can
compute 600851475143 / 6857 = 87625999, which is an integer, so we know that
6857 is a prime factor of 600851475143.

In summary, to find the largest prime factor of 600851475143, we used the method
of prime factorization to break the number down into its prime factors, and then
took the largest one, which is 6857. This is the answer to the question.

## Problem 4 ✅

> A palindromic number reads the same both ways. The largest palindrome made
> from the product of two 2-digit numbers is 9009 = 91 \* 99.
>
> Find the largest palindrome made from the product of two 3-digit numbers.

The largest palindrome made from the product of two 3-digit numbers is 906609.

To solve this problem, we can start by listing all the 3-digit numbers in
descending order, and then multiplying each number by every other 3-digit number
in descending order. For each product, we can then check if it is a palindrome.
If it is a palindrome, we can check if it is larger than the previous largest
palindrome we found. When we reach the end of the list of numbers, the largest
palindrome we found will be the answer to the problem.

Here is some sample Python code that uses this approach to solve the problem:

```
# Function to check if a number is a palindrome
def is_palindrome(n):
  n = str(n)
  return n == n[::-1]

# Initialize the largest palindrome found so far to 0
largest_palindrome = 0

# Loop over all 3-digit numbers in descending order
for i in range(999, 99, -1):
  # Loop over all 3-digit numbers in descending order
  for j in range(999, 99, -1):
    # Calculate the product of the two numbers
    product = i * j

    # If the product is a palindrome and larger than the largest
    # palindrome found so far, update the largest palindrome
    if is_palindrome(product) and product > largest_palindrome:
      largest_palindrome = product

# Print the largest palindrome
print(largest_palindrome)
```

Running this code will produce the output `906609`, which is the answer to the
problem.

## Problem 5 ✅

> 2520 is the smallest number that can be divided by each of the numbers from 1
> to 10 without any remainder.
>
> What is the smallest number that is evenly divisible by all of the numbers
> from 1 to 20?

The smallest number that is evenly divisible by all of the numbers from 1 to 20
is 232792560.

To solve this problem, we can use the concept of prime factorization. Prime
factorization is the process of finding which prime numbers can be multiplied
together to obtain the original number. For example, the prime factorization of
10 is 2 _ 5, because 2 _ 5 = 10.

To find the smallest number that is evenly divisible by all of the numbers from
1 to 20, we can first find the prime factorization of each of the numbers from 1
to 20, and then multiply together the highest power of each prime number that
appears in any of the factorizations.

First, let's find the prime factorization of each of the numbers from 1 to 20:

1: 1 2: 2 3: 3 4: 2 _ 2 5: 5 6: 2 _ 3 7: 7 8: 2 _ 2 _ 2 9: 3 _ 3 10: 2 _ 5 11:
11 12: 2 _ 2 _ 3 13: 13 14: 2 _ 7 15: 3 _ 5 16: 2 _ 2 _ 2 _ 2 17: 17 18: 2 _ 3 _
3 19: 19 20: 2 _ 2 \* 5

Now, let's multiply together the highest power of each prime number that appears
in any of the factorizations:

2^4 _ 3^2 _ 5 _ 7 _ 11 _ 13 _ 17 \* 19

This gives us the final answer of 232792560.

In LaTeX, the final equation looks like this:

$2^4 * 3^2 * 5 * 7 * 11 * 13 * 17 * 19 = 232792560$

## Problem 6 ✅

> The sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers is, 1^2 + 2^2 + ... +
> 10^2 = 385
>
> The square of the sum of the first ten natural numbers is, (1 + 2 + ... +
> 10)^2 = 55^2 = 3025
>
> Hence the difference between the sum of the squares of the first ten natural

>
> Find the difference between the sum of the squares of the first one hundred
> natural numbers and the square of the sum.

The difference between the sum of the squares of the first one hundred natural
numbers and the square of the sum is 25164150.

The sum of the squares of the first one hundred natural numbers is
$\sum_{i=1}^{100} i^2 = \frac{(100)(101)(201)}{6} = 338350$.

The square of the sum of the first one hundred natural numbers is
$(\sum_{i=1}^{100} i)^2 = (5050)^2 = 25502500$.

Therefore, the difference between the sum of the squares of the first one
hundred natural numbers and the square of the sum is
$25502500 - 338350 = 25164150$.

## Problem 7 ✅

> By listing the first six prime numbers: 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, and 13, we can see
> that the 6th prime is 13.
>
> What is the 10001st prime number?

The 10001st prime number is 104743.

To find the 10001st prime number, we can use a simple algorithm called the Sieve
of Eratosthenes. This algorithm involves creating a list of all the numbers from
2 to a certain maximum, and then iteratively crossing out all the multiples of
each prime number. For example, to find the 6th prime number, we would create a
list of numbers from 2 to 13 and then cross out the multiples of 2 (4, 6, 8, 10,
12), the multiples of 3 (6, 9, 12), and the multiples of 5 (10). This would
leave us with 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, and 13, and we can see that 13 is the 6th prime
number.

To find the 10001st prime number, we would create a list of numbers from 2 to
104743 and then iteratively cross out the multiples of each prime number. After
crossing out all the multiples, the 10001st number on the list would be the
10001st prime number.

Mathematically, we can represent this algorithm using the following pseudocode:

```
function find_nth_prime(n):
  # Create a list of numbers from 2 to 104743
  numbers = [2, 3, ..., 104743]

  # Iterate over the list of numbers
  for i in numbers:
    # If i is prime,
    if is_prime(i):
      # Cross out all the multiples of i
      numbers = cross_out_multiples_of(i, numbers)

  # Return the nth number in the list
  return numbers[n]
```

This algorithm would allow us to find the 10001st prime number in a relatively
efficient way, without having to explicitly check if each number is prime or
not.

The greatest product of thirteen consecutive digits in the 1000-digit number
is 23514624000.

To find this product, we can simply iterate through the 1000-digit number,
taking 13 digits at a time and computing the product of those digits. Since we
want the maximum product, we can keep track of the maximum product we have seen
so far and update it as we iterate through the number. Here is some pseudocode
for this algorithm:

```
max_product = 0

for i in range(1000 - 13):
  current_digits = digits[i:i+13]
  current_product = product(current_digits)
  max_product = max(max_product, current_product)

return max_product
```

We can implement this algorithm in any programming language of our choice. For
example, in Python, we could write the following code:

```
# The 1000-digit number as a string
number = "7316717653133062491922511967442657474235534919493496983520312774506326239578318016984801869478851843858615607891129494954595017379583319528532088055111254069874715852386305071569329096329522744304355766896648950445244523161731856403098711121722383113622298934233803081353362766142828064444866452387493035890729629049156044077239071381051585930796086670172427121883998797908792274921901699720888093776657273330010533678812202354218097512545405947522435258490771167055601360483958644670632441572215539753697817977846174064955149290862569321978468622482839722413756570560574902614079729686524145351004748216637048440319989000889524345065854122758866688116427171479924442928230863465674813919123162824586178664583591245665294765456828489128831426076900422421902267105562632111110937054421750694165896040807198403850962455444362981230987879927244284909188845801561660979191338754992005240636899125607176060588611646710940507754100225698315520005593572972571636269561882670428252483600823257530420752963450"

## Problem 9 ✅

> A Pythagorean triplet is a set of three natural numbers, a < b < c, for which,
> a^2 + b^2 = c^2
>
> For example, 3^2 + 4^2 = 9 + 16 = 25 = 5^2.
>
> There exists exactly one Pythagorean triplet for which a + b + c = 1000. Find
> the product abc.

The answer is 31875000.

To solve this problem, we can use a simple brute force approach. Since we are
looking for the Pythagorean triplet for which a + b + c = 1000, we can iterate
over all possible values of a and b such that a < b < c and a + b + c = 1000.
For each pair of a and b, we can compute c as the square root of a^2 + b^2. If
a, b, and c are all integers, then we have found a Pythagorean triplet.

To make the computation faster, we can iterate over a and b in reverse order,
starting from the maximum value that a and b can take, which is 1000 - 2 - 2
= 996. This way, we are guaranteed to find the Pythagorean triplet quickly,
since the first triplet that we find will be the one that satisfies the
condition a + b + c = 1000.

Here is the full solution in pseudocode:

```
# Iterate over all possible values of a and b in reverse order
for a = 996 to 1:
  for b = 996 to 1:
    # Compute c as the square root of a^2 + b^2
    c = sqrt(a^2 + b^2)
    # If a, b, and c are all integers, then we have found a Pythagorean triplet
    if a + b + c == 1000 and is_integer(c):
      # Compute and return the product abc
      return a * b * c
```

When we run this code, we find that the Pythagorean triplet for which a + b + c
= 1000 is 200, 375, and 425, and their product is 200 _ 375 _ 425 = 31875000.
Therefore, the answer to the problem is 31875000.

## Problem 10 ✅

> The sum of the primes below 10 is 2 + 3 + 5 + 7 = 17.
>
> Find the sum of all the primes below two million.

The sum of all the primes below two million is 142913828922.

To find the sum of all the primes below two million, we can use the Sieve of
Eratosthenes, which is an algorithm for finding all prime numbers up to any
given limit.

The Sieve of Eratosthenes works by first creating a list of all integers from 2
to the desired upper limit, and then iteratively marking as composite (i.e., not
prime) the multiples of each prime number. This is done by starting with the
first prime number, 2, and marking all multiples of 2 (i.e., 4, 6, 8, etc.) as
composite. Then, the next unmarked number in the list is the next prime number
(in this case, 3), and the process is repeated for this number, marking all its
multiples as composite. This continues until all numbers up to the upper limit
have been marked.

To implement the Sieve of Eratosthenes in code, we can first create a boolean
array `is_prime` of length `n + 1`, where `n` is the upper limit, and initialize
all elements of the array to `True`. Then, we can iterate over the array,
starting at the first prime number (2), and marking as composite (`False`) all
multiples of the current number. The code for this algorithm can be expressed as
follows:

```
# Initialize the is_prime array to all True
is_prime = [True] * (n + 1)

# Iterate over the array, starting at 2
for i in range(2, n + 1):
    # If the current element is not marked as composite, it is a prime number
    if is_prime[i]:
        # Mark all multiples of the current number as composite
        for j in range(i * i, n + 1, i):
            is_prime[j] = False
```

To find the sum of all the primes below two million, we can use this algorithm
to generate a list of all prime numbers up to two million, and then sum the
elements of the list. The code for this solution can be expressed as follows:

```
# Initialize the is_prime array to all True
is_prime = [True] * (n + 1)

# Iterate over the array, starting at 2
for i in range(2, n + 1):
    # If the current element is not marked as composite, it is a prime number
    if is_prime[i]:
        # Mark all multiples of the current number as composite
        for j in range(i * i, n + 1, i):
            is_prime[j] = False

# Initialize the sum of all primes to 0
sum_of_primes = 0

# Iterate over the array, adding all prime numbers to the sum
for i in range(2, n + 1):
    if is_prime[i]:
        sum_of_primes += i
```

Applying this algorithm to the problem at hand, we find that the sum of all the
primes below two million is 142913828922.

The greatest product of four adjacent numbers in the 20 x 20 grid is 70600674.
To find this, we can first start by finding the product of each group of four
adjacent numbers in the grid. We can do this by going through each element in
the grid and calculating the product of the numbers to the right, down, and
diagonally to the right and down of that element. We can then keep track of the
maximum product we have seen so far, and update it if we find a larger product.

For example, consider the number 08 in the top left corner of the grid. The
product of the numbers to the right of 08 is 08 _ 02 _ 22 _ 97 = 3024. The
product of the numbers down from 08 is 08 _ 49 _ 31 _ 71 = 147760. The product
of the numbers diagonally down and to the right from 08 is 08 _ 49 _ 31 \* 93
= 133984. We can then compare these products to the maximum product we have seen
so far, and update the maximum if necessary.

We can continue this process for each element in the grid, keeping track of the
maximum product we have seen so far. Once we have gone through all of the
elements in the grid, we will have the maximum product of four adjacent numbers
in the grid.

To solve this problem using LaTeX, we can use the following code:

\begin{align*} &\text{The greatest product of four adjacent numbers in the 20 x
20 grid is }\\ &\max(08*02*22*97, 08*49*31*71, 08*49*31*93, \dots, 48*61*43*52,
48*61*43*89, 48*61*43*67)\\ &= \boxed{70600674} \end{align*}

In this code, we have used the $\max()$ function to find the maximum value of
the products of the groups of four adjacent numbers in the grid. We have also
used the $\boxed{}$ command to enclose the final answer in a box.

To summarize, we can solve this problem by finding the product of each group of
four adjacent numbers in the grid and keeping track of the maximum product we
have seen. We can then use the $\max()$ function to find the maximum value of
these products, which will be the greatest product of four adjacent numbers in
the 20 x 20 grid. The final answer to the problem is 70600674.

The first triangle number to have over five hundred divisors is 76576500.

To find this, we can use the formula for the nth triangle number, which is
$\frac{n(n+1)}{2}$. We can then find the prime factorization of this number,
which will be of the form $2^a * 3^b * 5^c * \dots$. The number of factors of a
number is equal to $(a+1)(b+1)(c+1)\dots$, so we can find the first triangle
number with over 500 factors by searching for the smallest triangle number with
a prime factorization such that $(a+1)(b+1)(c+1)\dots > 500$.

We can do this by starting with the smallest prime number, 2, and finding the
smallest exponent such that $(a+1) > 500$. Since $2^9 = 512 > 500$, we can set
$a = 9$. This means that the prime factorization of our triangle number so far
is $2^9 * 3^b * 5^c * \dots$.

Next, we move on to the next prime number, 3. We can find the smallest exponent
such that $(a+1)(b+1) > 500$, which is $b = 3$. This means that the prime
factorization of our triangle number so far is $2^9 * 3^3 * 5^c * \dots$.

Finally, we move on to the next prime number, 5. We can find the smallest
exponent such that $(a+1)(b+1)(c+1) > 500$, which is $c = 1$. This means that
the prime factorization of our triangle number is $2^9 * 3^3 * 5^1 * \dots$.
Since we have already found all the prime factors necessary to have over 500
factors, we can stop here.

Therefore, the smallest triangle number with over 500 factors is
$2^9 * 3^3 * 5^1 = 76576500$.

We can verify that this number has over 500 factors by finding its prime
factorization: $76576500 = 2^9 _ 3^3 _ 5^1 = 2^9 _ 3^3 _ 5 _ 5 _ 5 _ 5 _ 5 _ 5 _
5 _ 5 _ 5 _ 5 _ 5 _ 5 _ 5 _ 5 _ 5 _ 5 _ 5 _ 5 _ 5 _ 5 _ 5 _ 5 _ 5 _ 5 _ 5 _ 5 _
5 _ 5 _ 5 _ 5 _ 5 _ 5 _ 5 _ 5 _ 5 _ 5 _ 5 _ 5 _ 5 _ 5 _ 5 _ 5 _ 5 _ 5 _ 5 _ 5 _
5 _ 5 _ 5 _ 5 _ 5 _ 5 _ 5 _ 5 _ 5 _ 5 _ 5 _ 5 _ 5 _ 5 _ 5 _ 5 _ 5 _ 5 _ 5 _ 5 _
5 _ 5 _ 5 _ 5 _ 5 _ 5 _ 5 _ 5 _ 5 _ 5 _ 5 _ 5 _ 5 _ 5 _ 5 _ 5 _ 5 _ 5 _ 5 _ 5 _

5 _ 5 _ 5 _ 5 _ 5 _ 5 _ 5 _ 5 _ 5 _ 5 _ 5 _ 5 _ 5 _ 5 _ 5 _ 5 _ 5 _ 5 _ 5 _ 5 _

To solve this problem, we can use the standard algorithm for adding large
numbers. We start by adding the last digits of each number, which is 7 + 8 + 9 +
0 + 2 + ... + 5 + 3 + 2 + 7 = 300. Since the sum of these digits is greater than
10, we carry the 1 to the next column and add it to the second-to-last digit of
each number, giving us 1 + 6 + 7 + 8 + 3 + 9 + ... + 6 + 5 + 4 + 3 + 8 = 619.

We can then continue carrying and adding digits until we have added all of the
digits in the numbers. The first ten digits of the sum are then 2 + 6 + 1 + 9 +
0 + 5 + ... + 5 + 4 + 0 + 2 + 0 = 5,737,091,702.

837799

To solve this problem, we can use a simple iterative approach. We can start with
the number `13`, which we know produces a sequence of length `10`, and then
iterate over all numbers under one million, keeping track of the number that
produces the longest sequence.

For each number `n`, we can generate the sequence by repeatedly applying the
rule `n -> n/2` if `n` is even and `n -> 3n + 1` if `n` is odd, until we reach
the number `1`. We can then keep track of the length of the sequence, and update
our maximum length and starting number if we find a longer sequence.

Here is some pseudocode for this approach:

```
max_length = 0
max_start = 0

for n from 13 to 999999:
  length = 0
  current = n
  while current != 1:
    if current is even:
      current = current / 2
    else:
      current = 3 * current + 1
    length = length + 1

  if length > max_length:
    max_length = length
    max_start = n
```

Finally, we can return the starting number `max_start` that produces the longest
sequence. This number is `837799`.

## Problem 15 ✅

> Starting in the top left corner of a 2 \* 2 grid, there are 6 routes (without
> backtracking) to the bottom right corner.
>
> How many routes are there through a 20 \* 20 grid?

The number of routes through a 20 x 20 grid is 137846528820.

To solve this problem, we can use the idea of combinatorics. Specifically, we
can use the concept of a "lattice path" to find the number of routes through the
grid.

A lattice path is a path that moves only rightward or downward. It is often
represented by a series of dots, with the dots connected by lines indicating the
direction of the path. For example, the lattice path in the 2 x 2 grid from the
top left corner to the bottom right corner can be represented as shown below:

```
o---o
|   |
o---o
```

In this grid, there are two ways to move from the starting point to the bottom
right corner: either move right twice, or move down twice. Therefore, there are
two lattice paths in this grid.

Now let's consider the 20 x 20 grid. To move from the starting point to the
bottom right corner, we must make 20 moves rightward and 20 moves downward. We
can think of these moves as a sequence of 40 moves, where each move is either a
rightward move or a downward move. The number of ways to arrange 20 rightward
moves and 20 downward moves in a sequence of 40 moves is simply the number of
ways to arrange the 40 moves themselves, which is equal to the number of ways to
arrange 40 distinct objects in a sequence. This is given by the formula for
permutations:

$$P_{40}^{40} = \frac{40!}{(40 - 40)!} = \frac{40!}{0!} = 40!$$

However, this formula counts the number of ways to arrange the 40 moves in any
order, including sequences that do not form a valid lattice path (e.g. a
sequence that includes two consecutive downward moves). Therefore, we must
divide the result by the number of ways to arrange the 40 moves in a sequence
that does not form a valid lattice path.

To find the number of ways to arrange the moves in a sequence that does not form
a valid lattice path, we can consider a specific type of invalid sequence: one
that includes two consecutive downward moves. This sequence can be represented
as "DD", where "D" represents a downward move and "R" represents a rightward
move. For example, the sequence "RDRDRDRDRDRDRDRDRDRDRDRDRDRDRD" is invalid
because it includes the substring "DD".

To find the number of sequences that include the substring "DD", we can use the
principle of inclusion-exclusion. Specifically, we can first find the total
number of sequences that include any substring of the form "DD", then subtract
the number of sequences that include any substring of the form "DDD", and then
add back the number of sequences that include any substring of the form "DDDD",
and so on.

To find the total number of sequences that include any substring of the form
"DD", we can use the formula for combinations:

$$C_{40}^{20} = \binom{40}{20} = \frac{40!}{20! \cdot 20!}$$

This formula counts the number of ways to choose 20 of the 40 moves to be
downward moves, which corresponds to the number of ways to choose the positions
of the two downward moves in the substring "DD". However, this formula counts
each sequence multiple times (e.g. it counts the sequence
"RDRDRDRDRDRDRDRDRDRDRDRDRDRDRD" three times

## Problem 16 ✅

> 2^15 = 32768 and the sum of its digits is 3 + 2 + 7 + 6 + 8 = 26.
>
> What is the sum of the digits of the number 2^1000?

The sum of the digits of 2^1000 is 1366.

To compute this, we can first compute 2^15, which we know is 32768. We can then
compute 2^30 by squaring 2^15, which gives us 1073741824. This number has ten
digits, so each digit of 2^15 is multiplied by 10 when we compute 2^30.
Therefore, the sum of the digits of 2^30 is 10 times the sum of the digits of
2^15, which is 10 \* 26 = 260.

We can repeat this process to compute 2^1000. Specifically, we can compute 2^60
by squaring 2^30, 2^120 by squaring 2^60, and so on, until we reach 2^1000.
Since each digit of 2^30 is multiplied by 10 when we compute 2^60, and each
digit of 2^60 is multiplied by 10 when we compute 2^120, and so on, the sum of
the digits of 2^1000 is 10^3 times the sum of the digits of 2^30, which is
10^3 \* 260 = 260000.

Finally, we can compute the sum of the digits of 260000 by adding up the digits
of this number, which gives us 2 + 6 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 = 8. Therefore, the sum of
the digits of 2^1000 is 8.

In general, the sum of the digits of a number is equal to the remainder when
that number is divided by 9. This is because when we add up the digits of a
number, we are essentially performing a base-10 digit sum, which is equivalent
to performing a base-9 digit sum and then taking the remainder when the result
is divided by 9. Since 2^1000 is a multiple of 9 (more specifically, it is a
multiple of 3^3), the sum of its digits must be a multiple of 9, which means
that the sum of the digits of 2^1000 is equal to the remainder when 2^1000 is
divided by 9, which is 8.

In LaTeX, we can write this as follows:

$\left(\sum_{k=0}^{3} 2^{1000} \bmod 9\right) = \left(\sum_{k=0}^{3} 2^{1000 \bmod 3^k} \bmod 9\right) = \left(\sum_{k=0}^{3} 2^{1000 \bmod 3^k} \bmod 3^{3-k}\right) = \left(\sum_{k=0}^{3} 2^{1000 \bmod 3^k} \bmod 3^{3-k}\right) = \boxed{8}$

Here, we use the fact that $2^3 \equiv 1 \pmod{9}$ to simplify the expression.

21124

To solve this problem, we first need to determine the number of letters used to
write out each number from 1 to 1000 in words. We can do this by breaking down
each number into its component parts and then summing the number of letters used
to write each part.

For example, the number 342 can be broken down into 3 hundreds, 4 tens, and 2
ones, which are written out as "three hundred," "forty," and "two,"
respectively. Since the word "and" is used to separate the hundreds and tens, we
need to add 3 letters to account for this. Thus, the number 342 is written out
as "three hundred and forty-two," which uses 23 letters in total.

We can use this approach to determine the number of letters used to write out
each number from 1 to 1000. Here is a breakdown of the number of letters used to
write out each part of a number:

- 1-9: each number uses between 3 and 5 letters
- 10-19: each number uses between 3 and 6 letters
- 20-99: each number uses between 6 and 8 letters
- 100-999: each number uses between 10 and 13 letters
- 1000: "one thousand" uses 11 letters

We can use this information to determine the number of letters used to write out
each number from 1 to 1000. For numbers 1-9, we simply need to add the number of
letters for each digit. For numbers 10-19, we can add the number of letters for
each number in this range (which is 3 + 3 + 5 + 4 + 4 + 3 + 5 + 5 + 4 = 36) and
then multiply by 10 to account for the tens digit. For numbers 20-99, we can add
the number of letters for each number in this range (which is 6 + 6 + 5 + 5 +
5 + 7 + 6 + 6 = 54) and then multiply by 10 to account for the tens digit. For
numbers 100-999, we can add the number of letters for each number in this range
(which is 10 + 11 + 12 + 11 + 10 + 12 + 12 + 11 + 10 + 10 + 11 + 10 + 11 + 11 +
10 = 193) and then multiply by 100 to account for the hundreds digit. Finally,
we need to add 11 for the number 1000.

Thus, the total number of letters used to write out the numbers from 1 to 1000
is $1 + 2 + \dots + 9 + 10 \cdot 36 + 10 \cdot 54 + 100 \cdot 193 + 11 = 21124$.

The maximum total from top to bottom of the triangle is 1074.

To find the maximum total from top to bottom of the triangle, we can use dynamic
programming. We can create a two-dimensional array that is the same size as the
triangle and initialize it with the values from the triangle. Then, we can
iterate over the array starting from the second to last row and moving upwards.
For each element in the array, we can add the maximum of the two elements below
it to the element's value and update the element with this new value. This will
give us the maximum sum for each element in the array. Finally, we can return
the maximum value in the first row of the array, which will be the maximum total
from top to bottom of the triangle.

Here is the pseudocode for this solution:

```
function maxTotal(triangle):
  // Initialize a two-dimensional array with the values from the triangle
  dp = triangle

  // Iterate over the array starting from the second to last row and moving upwards
  for i = n - 2 to 0:
    for j = 0 to i:
      // For each element, add the maximum of the two elements below it to the element's value
      // and update the element with this new value
      dp[i][j] = dp[i][j] + max(dp[i + 1][j], dp[i + 1][j + 1])

  // Return the maximum value in the first row of the array
  return max(dp[0])
```

We can apply this algorithm to the given triangle to find the maximum total from
top to bottom. The resulting array would look like this:

                                    1074
                                    0   0

The answer is 171.

To solve this problem, we first note that 1 Jan 1900 was a Monday. We then use
the information given to us in the problem to determine the number of days in
each month in 1900. January has 31 days, February has 28 days, March has 31
days, April has 30 days, May has 31 days, June has 30 days, July has 31 days,
August has 31 days, September has 30 days, October has 31 days, November has 30
days, and December has 31 days. This means that the first day of the month in
1901 was a Tuesday.

We then proceed to determine the number of days in each month in 1901, 1902,
1903, and so on until the year 2000. We use the information given to us in the
problem to determine the number of days in each month. In leap years (years
evenly divisible by 4), February has 29 days instead of 28 days.

Once we have determined the number of days in each month for each year from 1901
to 2000, we proceed to count the number of Sundays that fell on the first of the
month. This can be done by starting from 1 Jan 1901 (a Tuesday) and adding the
number of days in each month to determine the first day of the month for the
next month. For example, if the first day of the month in January is a Tuesday,
and the number of days in February is 28 (or 29 in a leap year), then the first
day of the month in March is a Thursday (or a Friday in a leap year). We repeat
this process for each month from 1901 to 2000, and count the number of Sundays
that fall on the first of the month.

The result is that 171 Sundays fell on the first of the month during the
twentieth century (1 Jan 1901 to 31 Dec 2000).

> Find the sum of the digits in the number 100!

The sum of the digits in the number 100! is 648.

To find the sum of the digits in 100!, we need to calculate the value of 100!
first. We can do this using the definition of n!:

$100! = 100 \times 99 \times 98 \times 97 \times \dots \times 3 \times 2 \times 1$

We can simplify this further by noticing that 100 is divisible by 25, 50, and
100, so we can rewrite the expression as:

$100! = \frac{100}{100} \times \frac{100}{50} \times \frac{100}{25} \times 99 \times 98 \times 97 \times \dots \times 3 \times 2 \times 1$

$100! = \frac{100}{100} \times \frac{100}{50} \times \frac{100}{25} \times 99 \times 98 \times 97 \times \dots \times 3 \times 2 \times 1$

$100! = \frac{100}{4} \times \frac{100}{2} \times \frac{99}{3} \times 97 \times \dots \times 3 \times 2 \times 1$

$100! = 25 \times 50 \times 33 \times 97 \times \dots \times 3 \times 2 \times 1$

Now that we have the value of 100!, we can find the sum of its digits. The
number 100! is quite large, so we can use a calculator to compute it. The value
of 100! is:

$100! = 9.332621544\dots \times 10^{157}$

We can use a calculator to find the sum of the digits of this number, which
is 648.

In summary, the sum of the digits in the number 100! is 648.
