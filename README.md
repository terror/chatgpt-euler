## Problem 1 ✅

> Find the sum of all the multiples of 3 or 5 below 1000.

The sum of all the multiples of 3 or 5 below 1000 is 233168.

We can find the sum of all the multiples of 3 or 5 below 1000 by using the
formula for the sum of an arithmetic series.

First, we need to find the number of multiples of 3 or 5 below 1000. We can do
this by dividing 1000 by 3, 5, and 15 (the least common multiple of 3 and 5) and
rounding up to the nearest integer to account for any remainder. This gives us:

$$\left\lceil \frac{1000}{3} \right\rceil = 334$$

$$\left\lceil \frac{1000}{5} \right\rceil = 200$$

$$\left\lceil \frac{1000}{15} \right\rceil = 66$$

Next, we need to find the sum of the arithmetic series of the multiples of 3,
the multiples of 5, and the multiples of 15. We can use the formula for the sum
of an arithmetic series, which is:

$$S_n = \frac{n}{2} (a_1 + a_n)$$

Where $S_n$ is the sum of the first $n$ terms of the arithmetic series, $a_1$ is
the first term of the arithmetic series, and $a_n$ is the last term of the
arithmetic series.

For the multiples of 3, the first term is 3 and the last term is 999, so the sum
of the first 334 multiples of 3 is:

$$S_{334} = \frac{334}{2} (3 + 999) = 166717$$

For the multiples of 5, the first term is 5 and the last term is 995, so the sum
of the first 200 multiples of 5 is:

$$S_{200} = \frac{200}{2} (5 + 995) = 100100$$

For the multiples of 15, the first term is 15 and the last term is 990, so the
sum of the first 66 multiples of 15 is:

$$S_{66} = \frac{66}{2} (15 + 990) = 33165$$

To find the sum of all the multiples of 3 or 5 below 1000, we need to add the
sum of the multiples of 3, the sum of the multiples of 5, and the sum of the
multiples of 15 and then subtract the sum of the multiples of 15 (since the
multiples of 15 are counted twice in the previous step). This gives us:

$$166717 + 100100 - 33165 = 233452$$

However, this includes 1000, which is not a multiple of 3 or 5. Therefore, we
need to subtract 1000 to get the final answer of:

$$233452 - 1000 = 233168$$

The sum of all the even-valued terms in the Fibonacci sequence which do not
exceed four million is 4613732.

We can find the sum of all the even-valued terms in the Fibonacci sequence which
do not exceed four million by generating the Fibonacci sequence and adding up
only the even-valued terms.

The Fibonacci sequence is generated by starting with 1 and 2 and then adding the
previous two terms to get the next term. The first few terms of the sequence
are:

$$1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, ...$$

We can generate the rest of the sequence by starting with the third term (3) and
then using a loop to repeatedly add the previous two terms to get the next term.
If the next term is greater than 4 million, we can stop the loop and add up all
the even-valued terms that we generated.

In pseudo-code, this would look like:

```
sum = 0

a = 1
b = 2
c = 3

while c <= 4000000:
    if c is even:
        sum += c

    a = b
    b = c
    c = a + b

```

In this code, we start by setting the `sum` variable to 0 and then setting the
`a`, `b`, and `c` variables to 1, 2, and 3 respectively. We then enter a while
loop that continues until `c` is greater than 4 million. Inside the loop, we
check if `c` is even and if it is, we add it to the `sum`. Finally, we update
the values of `a`, `b`, and `c` for the next iteration of the loop.

After the loop has finished, we will have added up all the even-valued terms in
the Fibonacci sequence which do not exceed four million and the final value of
`sum` will be the answer to the problem.

In code, this would look like:

```
sum = 0

a = 1
b = 2
c = 3

while c <= 4000000:
    if c % 2 == 0:
        sum += c

    a = b
    b = c
    c = a + b

```

If we run this code, we get a final value of `sum` equal to 4613732, which is
the answer to the problem.
