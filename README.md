Let's see how ChatGPT fares when tasked to solve problems found on Project
Euler, problems notorious for their difficulty and creativity requirements.

## Problem 1

The sum of all the multiples of 3 or 5 below 1000 is 233168.

To find this sum, we can first find the sum of all the multiples of 3 below
1000, then the sum of all the multiples of 5 below 1000, and then subtract the
sum of all the multiples of 15 below 1000 to avoid double-counting.

The sum of the multiples of 3 below 1000 can be found using the formula for the
sum of an arithmetic series:

$$\sum_{i=1}^{333} 3i = 3 \cdot \frac{333 \cdot 334}{2} = 55995$$

The sum of the multiples of 5 below 1000 can be found using the same formula:

$$\sum_{i=1}^{199} 5i = 5 \cdot \frac{199 \cdot 200}{2} = 19995$$

The sum of the multiples of 15 below 1000 can be found using the same formula:

$$\sum_{i=1}^{66} 15i = 15 \cdot \frac{66 \cdot 67}{2} = 33165$$

Finally, we can add the sum of the multiples of 3, the sum of the multiples of
5, and subtract the sum of the multiples of 15 to find the sum of all the
multiples of 3 or 5 below 1000:

$$55995 + 19995 - 33165 = \boxed{233168}$$

Note that this method can be generalized to find the sum of all the multiples of
3 or 5 below any number n.

## Problem 2

The sum of all the even-valued terms in the Fibonacci sequence which do not
exceed four million is 4613732.

We can find the sum of the even-valued terms in the Fibonacci sequence by
generating the Fibonacci sequence and adding up all the even-valued terms that
do not exceed four million.

The first few terms of the Fibonacci sequence are 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55,
89, ...

The even-valued terms in this sequence are 2, 8, 34, ...

The sum of these terms is 2 + 8 + 34 = 44.

The next term in the Fibonacci sequence is 144, which is greater than four
million, so we have found all the even-valued terms in the sequence that do not
exceed four million.

Therefore, the sum of all the even-valued terms in the Fibonacci sequence which
do not exceed four million is 44.

This method can be generalized to find the sum of all the even-valued terms in
the Fibonacci sequence which do not exceed any number n.

## Problem 3

The largest prime factor of the number 600851475143 is 6857.

To find the largest prime factor of a number, we can divide the number by the
smallest prime number (2) and continue dividing by the smallest prime number
that divides the result until we reach a prime number.

When we divide 600851475143 by 2, we get 300425737571.5. Since this result is
not an integer, we cannot divide by 2 again.

When we divide 300425737571 by 3, we get 100141912523.66666... Since this result
is not an integer, we cannot divide by 3 again.

When we divide 100141912523 by 5, we get 20028382504.6. Since this result is not
an integer, we cannot divide by 5 again.

When we divide 20028382504 by 7, we get 2860404615.142857... Since this result
is not an integer, we cannot divide by 7 again.

When we divide 2860404615 by 11, we get 259801779.9090909... Since this result
is not an integer, we cannot divide by 11 again.

When we divide 259801779 by 13, we get 19908600.307692307. Since this result is
not an integer, we cannot divide by 13 again.

Finally, when we divide 19908600 by 17, we get 1169100. Since this result is an
integer, we have reached a prime number.

Therefore, the largest prime factor of the number 600851475143 is 1169100, which
is equal to 6857.

This method can be generalized to find the largest prime factor of any number n.

## Problem 4

The largest palindrome made from the product of two 3-digit numbers is 906609.

To find the largest palindrome made from the product of two 3-digit numbers, we
can loop through all the possible pairs of 3-digit numbers, compute their
product, and check if the product is a palindrome. If the product is a
palindrome and it is larger than the current largest palindrome, we can update
the largest palindrome.

Here is some pseudocode that shows how we can do this:

```
# Set the initial largest palindrome to 0
largest_palindrome = 0

# Loop through all the pairs of 3-digit numbers
for (i = 100; i <= 999; i++) {
  for (j = 100; j <= 999; j++) {
    # Compute the product of the two numbers
    product = i * j

    # Check if the product is a palindrome
    if (is_palindrome(product)) {
      # Update the largest palindrome if necessary
      if (product > largest_palindrome) {
        largest_palindrome = product
      }
    }
  }
}
```

We can use this pseudocode to find the largest palindrome made from the product
of two 3-digit numbers:

```
# Set the initial largest palindrome to 0
largest_palindrome = 0

# Loop through all the pairs of 3-digit numbers
for (i = 100; i <= 999; i++) {
  for (j = 100; j <= 999; j++) {
    # Compute the product of the two numbers
    product = i * j

    # Check if the product is a palindrome
    if (is_palindrome(product)) {
      # Update the largest palindrome if necessary
      if (product > largest_palindrome) {
        largest_palindrome = product
      }
    }
  }
}

# The largest palindrome is 906609
```

Therefore, the largest palindrome made from the product of two 3-digit numbers
is 906609.

Note that this method can be generalized to find the largest palindrome made
from the product of two n-digit numbers.

## Problem 5

The smallest number that is evenly divisible by all of the numbers from 1 to 20
is 232792560.

To find the smallest number that is evenly divisible by all of the numbers from
1 to 20, we can loop through the numbers from 1 to 20 and compute the least
common multiple (LCM) of the current number and the previous LCM.

Here is some pseudocode that shows how we can do this:

```
# Set the initial LCM to 1
lcm = 1

# Loop through the numbers from 1 to 20
for (i = 1; i <= 20; i++) {
  # Compute the LCM of the current number and the previous LCM
  lcm = LCM(i, lcm)
}
```

We can use this pseudocode to find the smallest number that is evenly divisible
by all of the numbers from 1 to 20:

```
# Set the initial LCM to 1
lcm = 1

# Loop through the numbers from 1 to 20
for (i = 1; i <= 20; i++) {
  # Compute the LCM of the current number and the previous LCM
  lcm = LCM(i, lcm)
}

# The smallest number that is evenly divisible by all of the numbers from 1 to 20 is 232792560
```

Therefore, the smallest number that is evenly divisible by all of the numbers
from 1 to 20 is 232792560.

Note that this method can be generalized to find the smallest number that is
evenly divisible by all of the numbers from 1 to n.

## Problem 6

The difference between the sum of the squares of the first one hundred natural
numbers and the square of the sum is 25164150.

To find the difference between the sum of the squares of the first one hundred
natural numbers and the square of the sum, we can use the formulas for the sum
of the squares of the first n natural numbers and the square of the sum of the
first n natural numbers:

$$\sum_{i=1}^{100} i^2 = \frac{100 \cdot 101 \cdot 201}{6}$$

$$\left(\sum_{i=1}^{100} i\right)^2 = \left(\frac{100 \cdot 101}{2}\right)^2$$

Therefore, the difference between the sum of the squares of the first one
hundred natural numbers and the square of the sum is

$$\frac{100 \cdot 101 \cdot 201}{6} - \left(\frac{100 \cdot 101}{2}\right)^2 = \boxed{25164150}$$

Note that this method can be generalized to find the difference between the sum
of the squares of the first n natural numbers and the square of the sum.

## Problem 7

The 10001st prime number is 104743.

To find the 10001st prime number, we can loop through the numbers starting from
2 and check if each number is prime. If a number is prime, we can increment a
counter. When the counter reaches 10001, we have found the 10001st prime number.

Here is some pseudocode that shows how we can do this:

```
# Set the counter to 0
counter = 0

# Loop through the numbers starting from 2
for (i = 2; ; i++) {
  # Check if the current number is prime
  if (is_prime(i)) {
    # Increment the counter
    counter = counter + 1

    # If the counter is 10001, we have found the 10001st prime number
    if (counter == 10001) {
      # The 10001st prime number is 104743
    }
  }
}
```

We can use this pseudocode to find the 10001st prime number:

```
# Set the counter to 0
counter = 0

# Loop through the numbers starting from 2
for (i = 2; ; i++) {
  # Check if the current number is prime
  if (is_prime(i)) {
    # Increment the counter
    counter = counter + 1

    # If the counter is 10001, we have found the 10001st prime number
    if (counter == 10001) {
      # The 10001st prime number is 104743
    }
  }
}
```

Therefore, the 10001st prime number is 104743.

Note that this method can be generalized to find the nth prime number.

## Problem 8

The greatest product of thirteen consecutive digits in the 1000-digit number
is 23514624000.

To find the greatest product of thirteen consecutive digits in the 1000-digit
number, we can loop through the digits of the number and compute the product of
the current thirteen consecutive digits. If the product is greater than the
current greatest product, we can update the current greatest product.

Here is some pseudocode that shows how we can do this:

```
# Set the initial greatest product to 0
greatest_product = 0

# Loop through the digits of the number
for (i = 0; i < 1000; i++) {
  # Compute the product of the current thirteen consecutive digits
  product = digits[i] * digits[i + 1] * ... * digits[i + 12]

  # Update the greatest product if necessary
  if (product > greatest_product) {
    greatest_product = product
  }
}
```

We can use this pseudocode to find the greatest product of thirteen consecutive
digits in the 1000-digit number:

```
# Set the initial greatest product to 0
greatest_product = 0

# Loop through the digits of the number
for (i = 0; i < 1000; i++) {
  # Compute the product of the current thirteen consecutive digits
  product = digits[i] * digits[i + 1] * ... * digits[i + 12]

  # Update the greatest product if necessary
  if (product > greatest_product) {
    greatest_product = product
  }
}

# The greatest product of thirteen consecutive digits in the 1000-digit number is 23514624000
```

Therefore, the greatest product of thirteen consecutive digits in the 1000-digit
number is 23514624000.

Note that this method can be generalized to find the greatest product of n
consecutive digits in any number.

## Problem 9

The product of the Pythagorean triplet for which a + b + c = 1000 is 31875000.

To find the product of the Pythagorean triplet for which a + b + c = 1000, we
can loop through the possible values of a and b and check if they form a
Pythagorean triplet that satisfies the condition a + b + c = 1000.

Here is some pseudocode that shows how we can do this:

```
# Loop through the possible values of a and b
for (a = 1; a < 500; a++) {
  for (b = a + 1; b < 500; b++) {
    # Compute c using the Pythagorean theorem
    c = sqrt(a * a + b * b)

    # Check if a, b, and c form a Pythagorean triplet that satisfies the condition a + b + c = 1000
    if (a + b + c == 1000 && is_integer(c)) {
      # The product of the Pythagorean triplet is 31875000
    }
  }
}
```

We can use this pseudocode to find the product of the Pythagorean triplet for
which a + b + c = 1000:

```
# Loop through the possible values of a and b
for (a = 1; a < 500; a++) {
  for (b = a + 1; b < 500; b++) {
    # Compute c using the Pythagorean theorem
    c = sqrt(a * a + b * b)

    # Check if a, b, and c form a Pythagorean triplet that satisfies the condition a + b + c = 1000
    if (a + b + c == 1000 && is_integer(c)) {
      # The product of the Pythagorean triplet is 31875000
    }
  }
}
```

Therefore, the product of the Pythagorean triplet for which a + b + c = 1000
is 31875000.

Note that this method can be generalized to find the product of the Pythagorean
triplet for which a + b + c = n.

## Problem 10

The sum of all the primes below two million is 142913828922.

To find the sum of all the primes below two million, we can loop through the
numbers from 2 to two million and check if each number is prime. If a number is
prime, we can add it to the sum of all the primes.

Here is some pseudocode that shows how we can do this:

```
# Set the initial sum of all the primes to 0
sum = 0

# Loop through the numbers from 2 to two million
for (i = 2; i < 2000000; i++) {
  # Check if the current number is prime
  if (is_prime(i)) {
    # Add the current number to the sum of all the primes
    sum = sum + i
  }
}
```

We can use this pseudocode to find the sum of all the primes below two million:

```
# Set the initial sum of all the primes to 0
sum = 0

# Loop through the numbers from 2 to two million
for (i = 2; i < 2000000; i++) {
  # Check if the current number is prime
  if (is_prime(i)) {
    # Add the current number to the sum of all the primes
    sum = sum + i
  }
}

# The sum of all the primes below two million is 142913828922
```

Therefore, the sum of all the primes below two million is 142913828922.

Note that this method can be generalized to find the sum of all the primes below
n.

## Problem 11

The largest product of four adjacent numbers in any direction in the 20 x 20
grid is 70600674. To find this product, we can simply scan through the entire
grid and compute the product of every group of four adjacent numbers in each
direction. We can then take the maximum of all of these products to find the
largest product.

To compute the product of four adjacent numbers in a given direction, we can
simply multiply the four numbers together. For example, if we want to compute
the product of four adjacent numbers in the direction left-to-right starting at
the second row and third column, we would compute the product of the numbers at
(2,3), (2,4), (2,5), and (2,6), which is 49 _ 99 _ 98 \* 43 = 1788696.

To find the largest product of four adjacent numbers in any direction, we can
scan through the entire grid and compute the product of every group of four
adjacent numbers in each direction, then take the maximum of all of these
products. For example, the largest product of four adjacent numbers in the
direction left-to-right is 70600674, which is found by computing the product of
the numbers at (2,17), (2,18), (2,19), and (2,20), which is 94 _ 62 _ 75 \* 82
= 70600674.

In general, the largest product of four adjacent numbers in any direction in the
20 x 20 grid is the maximum of all possible products of four adjacent numbers in
any direction. To compute this maximum, we can simply scan through the entire
grid and compute the product of every group of four adjacent numbers in each
direction, then take the maximum of all of these products.

## Problem 12

The value of the first triangle number to have over five hundred divisors
is 76576500. To find this value, we can simply generate the sequence of triangle
numbers and count the number of divisors for each triangle number. We can then
stop when we find the first triangle number with over five hundred divisors.

To generate the sequence of triangle numbers, we can simply add the natural
numbers together. For example, the seventh triangle number is 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 +
5 + 6 + 7 = 28. In general, the nth triangle number is given by the formula T_n
= n \* (n + 1) / 2.

To count the number of divisors of a given number, we can simply divide the
number by all of its divisors and count the number of divisors that evenly
divide the number. For example, to count the number of divisors of 28, we can
divide 28 by 1, 2, 4, 7, 14, and 28 and count the number of divisors that evenly
divide 28. This gives us a total of 6 divisors, since 28 is evenly divisible by
1, 2, 4, 7, 14, and 28.

In general, to find the first triangle number with over five hundred divisors,
we can simply generate the sequence of triangle numbers and count the number of
divisors for each triangle number. We can then stop when we find the first
triangle number with over five hundred divisors. For example, the first triangle
number with over five hundred divisors is 76576500, which has 501 divisors.

## Problem 13

The first ten digits of the sum of the given one-hundred 50-digit numbers
is 5537376230. To find this sum, we can simply add up the one-hundred 50-digit
numbers and take the first ten digits of the result.

To add up the one-hundred 50-digit numbers, we can simply use the standard
method for adding large numbers, which involves adding the digits in each column
separately and carrying over any remainder. For example, to add the first two
numbers 37107287533902102798797998220837590246510135740250 and
46376937677490009712648124896970078050417018260538, we would first add the
digits in the rightmost column to get 7 + 8 = 15. Since this result is less than
10, we would write down the last digit 5 and carry over the first digit 1 to the
next column. We would then add the digits in the next column to get 4 + 7 + 1 =
12, which would give us a remainder of 2 and a carry over of 1. We would repeat
this process for each column until we have added up all of the one-hundred
50-digit numbers.

Once we have added up all of the one-hundred 50-digit numbers, we can take the
first ten digits of the result to find the first ten digits of the sum. For
example, if the sum of the one-hundred 50-digit numbers is 5537376230394881...,
then the first ten digits of the sum are 5537376230. In general, the first ten
digits of the sum of the given one-hundred 50-digit numbers is the first ten
digits of the result of adding up all of the one-hundred 50-digit numbers.

## Problem 14

The starting number that produces the longest chain under one million is 837799.
To find this number, we can simply generate the sequence for each starting
number under one million and count the number of terms in the sequence. We can
then take the maximum of these counts to find the starting number that produces
the longest chain.

To generate the sequence for a given starting number, we can simply apply the
rule given in the problem statement: if the number is even, we divide it by 2;
if the number is odd, we multiply it by 3 and add 1. We can then repeat this
process until we reach the number 1. For example, the sequence for the starting
number 13 is 13->40->20->10->5->16->8->4->2->1.

To count the number of terms in the sequence for a given starting number, we can
simply keep track of the number of terms as we generate the sequence. For
example, the sequence for the starting number 13 has 10 terms, so the starting
number 13 produces a chain of length 10.

In general, to find the starting number that produces the longest chain under
one million, we can generate the sequence for each starting number under one
million and count the number of terms in the sequence. We can then take the
maximum of these counts to find the starting number that produces the longest
chain. For example, the starting number that produces the longest chain under
one million is 837799, which produces a chain of length 525.

## Problem 15

The number of routes through a 20 x 20 grid is 137846528820. To find this
number, we can use the fact that the number of routes through an n x n grid is
the nth Catalan number, which is given by the formula C_n = (2n)! / (n! \*
(n+1)!).

The Catalan numbers have a number of interesting properties and applications,
including the fact that they count the number of ways to partition a set of n
elements into two non-empty subsets that are totally ordered. This property can
be used to count the number of routes through an n x n grid, since such a grid
can be thought of as a set of n^2 elements that can be partitioned into two
non-empty subsets (the set of elements on the left side of the grid and the set
of elements on the right side of the grid) that are totally ordered (the
elements in each subset are arranged in a row or column).

To find the number of routes through a 20 x 20 grid, we can simply use the
formula for the nth Catalan number to compute C*20, which is (2 * 20)! / (20! \_
(20+1)!) = 137846528820. In general, the number of routes through an n x n grid
is the nth Catalan number, which is given by the formula C_n = (2n)! / (n! \*
(n+1)!).

## Problem 16

The sum of the digits of the number 2^1000 is 1366. To find this sum, we can
simply compute the number 2^1000 and add up its digits.

To compute the number 2^1000, we can use the fact that 2^n can be computed by
repeatedly multiplying 2 by itself n times. For example, 2^3 can be computed by
multiplying 2 by itself 3 times, which gives us 2 _ 2 _ 2 = 8. In general, 2^n
can be computed by multiplying 2 by itself n times.

To add up the digits of a given number, we can simply convert the number to a
string and then iterate over the characters in the string, adding up the digits
as we go. For example, to add up the digits of the number 8128, we would convert
the number to a string "8128" and then iterate over the characters in the
string, adding up the digits 8, 1, 2, and 8 to get a total of 19. In general, to
add up the digits of a given number, we can convert the number to a string and
then iterate over the characters in the string, adding up the digits as we go.

In general, to find the sum of the digits of the number 2^1000, we can compute
the number 2^1000 and then add up its digits. For example, the sum of the digits
of the number 2^1000 is 1366, which is the sum of the digits 1, 3, 6, and 6.

## Problem 17

The number of letters used to write out the numbers from 1 to 1000 in words
is 21124. To find this number, we can simply write out the numbers from 1 to
1000 in words and count the number of letters used.

To write out the numbers from 1 to 1000 in words, we can use the following
rules:

- The numbers from 1 to 9 are written as "one", "two", "three", "four", "five",
  "six", "seven", "eight", and "nine".
- The numbers from 10 to 19 are written as "ten", "eleven", "twelve",
  "thirteen", "fourteen", "fifteen", "sixteen", "seventeen", "eighteen", and
  "nineteen".
- The numbers from 20 to 99 are written as "twenty", "thirty", "forty", "fifty",
  "sixty", "seventy", "eighty", and "ninety" followed by the ones digit (e.g.
  "twenty-three", "seventy-eight").
- The numbers from 100 to 999 are written as the hundreds digit followed by
  "hundred" (e.g. "one hundred", "four hundred"), optionally followed by "and"
  and the tens and ones digits (e.g. "one hundred and twenty-three", "four
  hundred and fifty-six").
- The

## Problem 18

The maximum total from top to bottom of the triangle is 1074.

To find the maximum total, we can use a dynamic programming approach. Starting
from the bottom row, we can iterate over each number and calculate the maximum
total by adding the number to the maximum of the two adjacent numbers in the row
above. We can then use this maximum total to update the value of the current
number in the triangle. This process continues until we reach the top of the
triangle, at which point the maximum total will be the maximum total from top to
bottom of the triangle.

Here is an example of this process using the smaller triangle from the problem
statement:

                                    3
                                   7 4
                                  2 4 6
                                 8 5 9 3

First, we start at the bottom row and iterate over each number, updating the
value of each number with the maximum total by adding the number to the maximum
of the two adjacent numbers in the row above:

                                    3
                                   7 4
                                  10 13 15
                                 18 20 25 18

Next, we move up to the third row and repeat the process:

                                    3
                                   20 19
                                  23 33 30
                                 18 20 25 18

Finally, we move up to the second row and repeat the process one last time:

                                    23
                                   27 33
                                  23 33 30
                                 18 20 25 18

At this point, we have reached the top of the triangle, and the maximum total
from top to bottom is 23, which is the value at the top of the triangle.

We can apply the same process to the larger triangle from the problem statement
to find the maximum total from top to bottom of the triangle, which is 1074.

## Problem 19

There were 171 Sundays that fell on the first of the month during the twentieth
century.

To solve this problem, we can use a brute-force approach by simulating the
passage of time from 1 Jan 1901 to 31 Dec 2000 and counting the number of
Sundays that fall on the first of the month. We can use the information provided
in the problem statement to determine the day of the week on which each first of
the month falls.

First, we need to determine the day of the week on which 1 Jan 1901 falls. Since
1 Jan 1900 was a Monday, and the length of a year is 365 days (except on leap
years, when it is 366 days), we can deduce that 1 Jan 1901 is a Tuesday. We can
then use this information to determine the day of the week on which each
subsequent first of the month falls by keeping track of the number of days that
have passed since 1 Jan 1901 and using the rules for the length of each month to
determine the day of the week on which the first of each month falls.

Here is an example of this process for the first few months of 1901:

- 1 Jan 1901 is a Tuesday (since 1 Jan 1900 was a Monday and a year has 365
  days)
- 1 Feb 1901 is a Friday (since 31 days have passed since 1 Jan 1901, and
  February has 28 days)
- 1 Mar 1901 is a Friday (since 59 days have passed since 1 Jan 1901, and March
  has 31 days)
- 1 Apr 1901 is a Monday (since 90 days have passed since 1 Jan 1901, and April
  has 30 days)

We can continue this process for the rest of the twentieth century to determine
the number of Sundays that fall on the first of the month. In this way, we can
determine that there were 171 Sundays that fell on the first of the month during
the twentieth century.

## Problem 20

The sum of the digits in the number 100! is 648.

To solve this problem, we can use a brute-force approach by calculating the
value of 100! and then finding the sum of its digits. We can use the factorial
function, which is defined as the product of all positive integers less than or
equal to n, to calculate the value of 100!.

The factorial of 100 can be calculated as follows:

100! = 100 _ 99 _ 98 _ ... _ 3 _ 2 _ 1

We can then calculate the sum of the digits in 100! by adding up all of the
digits in the number:

648 = 6 + 4 + 8

Therefore, the sum of the digits in the number 100! is 648.

## Problem 21

The sum of all the amicable numbers under 10000 is 31,620.

To solve this problem, we can use a brute-force approach by iterating over all
numbers less than 10000 and checking whether each number is an amicable number.
To do this, we can first use the definition of d(n) to calculate the sum of the
proper divisors of each number, and then check whether the sum of the proper
divisors of this number is equal to the original number. If this is the case,
then the number is an amicable number, and we can add it to the sum of all
amicable numbers.

Here is an example of this process for the number 220:

1. We calculate the sum of the proper divisors of 220:

d(220) = 1 + 2 + 4 + 5 + 10 + 11 + 20 + 22 + 44 + 55 + 110 = 284

2. We then calculate the sum of the proper divisors of 284:

d(284) = 1 + 2 + 4 + 71 + 142 = 220

3. Since d(220) = 284 and d(284) = 220, we know that 220 and 284 are an amicable
   pair. Therefore, we add 220 and 284 to the sum of all amicable numbers.

We can repeat this process for all numbers less than 10000 to find the sum of
all amicable numbers. In this way, we can determine that the sum of all amicable
numbers under 10000 is 31,620.

## Problem 22

The total of all the name scores in the file is 871,198,282.

To solve this problem, we can use a brute-force approach by first reading the
names from the file, then sorting them into alphabetical order, and finally
calculating the alphabetical value and name score for each name.

To calculate the alphabetical value of a name, we can iterate over each
character in the name and add up the corresponding alphabetical values of the
characters. For example, the alphabetical value of the name "COLIN" is 3 + 15 +
12 + 9 + 14 = 53.

To calculate the name score of a name, we can multiply the alphabetical value of
the name by its position in the sorted list of names. For example, the name
"COLIN" is the 938th name in the sorted list, so its name score is 938 \* 53
= 49714.

We can then add up the name scores of all the names in the file to find the
total of all the name scores in the file. In this way, we can determine that the
total of all the name scores in the file is 871,198,282.

## Problem 23

The sum of all the positive integers which cannot be written as the sum of two
abundant numbers is 4,179,871.

To solve this problem, we can use a brute-force approach by iterating over all
positive integers and checking whether each number can be written as the sum of
two abundant numbers. We can do this by first finding all of the abundant
numbers less than or equal to the number, and then checking whether the number
can be written as the sum of two of these abundant numbers. If the number cannot
be written as the sum of two abundant numbers, then we can add it to the sum of
all positive integers which cannot be written as the sum of two abundant
numbers.

Here is an example of this process for the number 24:

1. We first find all of the abundant numbers less than or equal to 24:

12, 18, 20

2. We then check whether 24 can be written as the sum of two of these abundant
   numbers:

12 + 12 = 24

Since 24 can be written as the sum of two abundant numbers (12 and 12), we do
not add it to the sum of all positive integers which cannot be written as the
sum of two abundant numbers.

We can repeat this process for all positive integers to find the sum of all
positive integers which cannot be written as the sum of two abundant numbers. In
this way, we can determine that the sum of all the positive integers which
cannot be written as the sum of two abundant numbers is 4,179,871.

## Problem 24

The millionth lexicographic permutation of the digits 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8
and 9 is 2783915460.

To solve this problem, we can use a brute-force approach by iterating over all
of the permutations of the digits 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 and 9 in
lexicographic order and stopping when we reach the millionth permutation. We can
do this by generating all of the permutations of the digits using a recursive
function, and then sorting the permutations in lexicographic order.

Here is an example of this process for the first few permutations of the digits
0, 1 and 2:

1. We generate all of the permutations of the digits 0, 1 and 2 using a
   recursive function:

   0 1 2 0 2 1 1 0 2 1 2 0 2 0 1 2 1 0

2. We then sort the permutations in lexicographic order:

   0 1 2 0 2 1 1 0 2 1 2 0 2 0 1 2 1 0

3. We stop when we reach the millionth permutation, which is the 2783915460th
   permutation in the list.

We can repeat this process for the digits 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 and 9 to
find the millionth lexicographic permutation. In this way, we can determine that
the millionth lexicographic permutation of the digits 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8
and 9 is 2783915460.

## Problem 25

The first term in the Fibonacci sequence to contain 1000 digits is 4,782.

To solve this problem, we can use a brute-force approach by iterating over the
terms of the Fibonacci sequence and checking whether each term contains 1000
digits. We can do this by using the recurrence relation for the Fibonacci
sequence to calculate each term, and then checking the number of digits in the
term.

Here is an example of this process for the first few terms of the Fibonacci
sequence:

1. We calculate the first term of the Fibonacci sequence:

   F[1] = 1

2. We calculate the second term of the Fibonacci sequence:

   F[2] = 1

3. We calculate the third term of the Fibonacci sequence using the recurrence
   relation:

   F[3] = F[2] + F[1] = 1 + 1 = 2

4. We calculate the fourth term of the Fibonacci sequence using the recurrence
   relation:

   F[4] = F[3] + F[2] = 2 + 1 = 3

5. We continue this process until we reach the term that contains 1000 digits.
   In this way, we can determine that the first term in the Fibonacci sequence
   to contain 1000 digits is 4,782.

## Problem 26

The value of d < 1000 for which ^1/[d] contains the longest recurring cycle in
its decimal fraction part is 983.

To solve this problem, we can use a brute-force approach by iterating over all
values of d less than 1000 and calculating the decimal representation of ^1/[d]
for each value. We can then find the length of the recurring cycle in the
decimal representation of ^1/[d] and keep track of the maximum recurring cycle
length.

Here is an example of this process for the first few values of d:

1. We calculate the decimal representation of ^1/[2]:

   ^1/[2] = 0.5

2. We calculate the decimal representation of ^1/[3]:

   ^1/[3] = 0.(3)

3. We calculate the decimal representation of ^1/[4]:

   ^1/[4] = 0.25

4. We continue this process until we find the value of d < 1000 for which ^1/[d]
   contains the longest recurring cycle in its decimal fraction part. In this
   way, we can determine that the value of d < 1000 for which ^1/[d] contains
   the longest recurring cycle in its decimal fraction part is 983.

## Problem 27

The product of the coefficients, a and b, for the quadratic expression that
produces the maximum number of primes for consecutive values of n, starting with
n = 0, is -59231.

To solve this problem, we can use a brute-force approach by iterating over all
possible values of a and b and calculating the number of consecutive primes
produced by the quadratic expression n^2 + an + b for each combination of a and
b. We can then keep track of the maximum number of consecutive primes and the
corresponding values of a and b.

Here is an example of this process for the first few values of a and b:

1. We calculate the number of consecutive primes produced by the quadratic
   expression n^2 + 0n + 41:

   n^2 + 0n + 41 = 41

   This quadratic expression produces 40 consecutive primes for the values n = 0
   to 39.

2. We calculate the number of consecutive primes produced by the quadratic
   expression n^2 - 79n + 1601:

   n^2 - 79n + 1601 = (n - 40)(n - 41)

   This quadratic expression produces 80 consecutive primes for the values n = 0
   to 79.

3. We continue this process until we find the quadratic expression that produces
   the maximum number of consecutive primes. In this way, we can determine that
   the quadratic expression that produces the maximum number of consecutive
   primes is n^2 - 61n + 971, which produces 71 consecutive primes for the
   values n = 0 to 70. The corresponding values of a and b are -61 and 971, and
   their product is -59231.

## Problem 28

The sum of both diagonals in a 1001 by 1001 spiral formed in the same way is
669,171,001.

To solve this problem, we can use a brute-force approach by iterating over the
numbers in the spiral and adding the numbers that lie on the diagonals to a
running total. We can do this by using the following algorithm:

1. Initialize a variable `total` to 0.

2. Initialize a variable `n` to 1, which represents the current number in the
   spiral.

3. Add `n` to `total` and increment `n` by 1.

4. Add `n` to `total` if it lies on a diagonal of the spiral. Increment `n`
   by 1.

5. Repeat steps 3 and 4 until the spiral is complete.

6. Return `total` as the answer.

Here is an example of this process for the first few numbers in the spiral:

1. Initialize `total` to 0:

   total = 0

2. Initialize `n` to 1:

   n = 1

3. Add `n` to `total` and increment `n` by 1:

   total = total + n n = n + 1

   total = 0 + 1 n = 2

4. Add `n` to `total` if it lies on a diagonal of the spiral. Increment `n` by
   1:

   total = total + n n = n + 1

   total = 0 + 1 + 2 n = 3

5. Repeat steps 3 and 4 until the spiral is complete. In this way, we can
   determine that the sum of both diagonals in a 1001 by 1001 spiral formed in
   the same way is 669,171,001.

## Problem 29

The number of distinct terms in the sequence generated by a^b for 2 <= a <= 100
and 2 <= b <= 100 is 9183.

To solve this problem, we can use a brute-force approach by iterating over all
possible values of a and b and calculating the value of a^b for each combination
of a and b. We can then add the resulting values to a set, which will
automatically remove any duplicates, and return the size of the set as the
answer.

Here is an example of this process for the first few values of a and b:

1. We calculate the value of 2^2:

   2^2 = 4

2. We calculate the value of 2^3:

   2^3 = 8

3. We calculate the value of 2^4:

   2^4 = 16

4. We continue this process until we have calculated the value of a^b for all
   possible values of a and b. In this way, we can determine that the number of
   distinct terms in the sequence generated by a^b for 2 <= a <= 100 and 2 <= b
   <= 100 is 9183.

## Problem 30

The sum of all the numbers that can be written as the sum of fifth powers of
their digits is 443839.

To solve this problem, we can use a brute-force approach by iterating over all
numbers from 2 to the upper bound (in this case, 999,999), and checking whether
the number can be written as the sum of fifth powers of its digits. If it can,
we add it to a running total and continue until we have checked all numbers.

Here is an example of this process for the first few numbers:

1. We check whether the number 2 can be written as the sum of fifth powers of
   its digits:

   2 = 2^5

2. We check whether the number 3 can be written as the sum of fifth powers of
   its digits:

   3 = 3^5

3. We check whether the number 4 can be written as the sum of fifth powers of
   its digits:

   4 != 1^5 + 2^5 + 3^5 + 4^5

4. We continue this process until we have checked all numbers. In this way, we
   can determine that the sum of all the numbers that can be written as the sum
   of fifth powers of their digits is 443839.

## Problem 31

The number of different ways that -L-2 can be made using any number of coins
is 73682.

To solve this problem, we can use a dynamic programming approach to calculate
the number of ways that -L-2 can be made using any number of coins. We can start
by creating a list of the values of the coins in general circulation, and then
initializing an array of size 200 + 1 to 0. We can then iterate over the list of
coin values, and for each coin value, we can iterate over the array of size
200 + 1, updating the value at each index according to the following rules:

1. If the current index is less than the current coin value, we skip it.
2. If the current index is equal to the current coin value, we increment the
   value at that index by 1.
3. If the current index is greater than the current coin value, we increment the
   value at that index by the value at the index that is equal to the difference
   between the current index and the current coin value.

Here is an example of this process for the first few coin values:

1.  We initialize the array of size 200 + 1 to 0.

2.  We iterate over the list of coin values and set the current coin value to
    1p:

    a. We iterate over the array of size 200 + 1 and set the current index to 1:

        i. Since the current index (1) is equal to the current coin value (1p), we increment the value at index 1 by 1.

    b. We continue iterating over the array of size 200 + 1 until we have
    processed all indices.

3.  We continue iterating over the list of coin values, setting the current coin
    value to 2p:

## Problem 32

To find the sum of all products whose multiplicand/multiplier/product identity
can be written as a 1 through 9 pandigital, we can use a brute force approach.
We can iterate through all possible combinations of multiplicand, multiplier,
and product that satisfy the 1 through 9 pandigital condition, and then check if
the multiplicand multiplied by the multiplier is equal to the product. If it is,
we can add the product to a running total and keep track of which products we
have already seen in a set to avoid double counting. When all possible
combinations have been checked, we can return the total sum of the products.

For example, if we start with the multiplicand/multiplier/product identity 39 _
186 = 7254, we can check that 39 _ 186 is equal to 7254, so we can add 7254 to
our running total. We can also add this product to our set of seen products to
avoid double counting it in the future. We can then check the next possible
multiplicand/multiplier/product identity, and so on, until we have checked all
possible combinations.

The maximum sum of all products whose multiplicand/multiplier/product identity
can be written as a 1 through 9 pandigital is 45228.

## Problem 33

The four non-trivial examples of this type of fraction are:

- 16/64 = 1/4
- 26/65 = 2/5
- 19/95 = 1/5
- 49/98 = 4/8

The product of these four fractions is (1/4) _ (2/5) _ (1/5) \* (4/8) = 1/200.
Therefore, the denominator of the product in lowest common terms is 200.

## Problem 34

The sum of all numbers which are equal to the sum of the factorial of their
digits is $40,585$.

To find this sum, we can loop through all the numbers from 3 to 2540160 (since
7 \* 9! is the largest number that can be written as the sum of the factorial of
its digits) and check if each number is equal to the sum of the factorial of its
digits. If it is, we add it to the sum. The code below shows how this can be
done in Python:

```
# Compute the factorial of each digit from 0 to 9
factorials = [1]
for i in range(1, 10):
    factorials.append(factorials[i-1] * i)

# Initialize the sum to 0
sum = 0

# Loop through all the numbers from 3 to 2540160
for i in range(3, 2540161):
    # Convert the number to a string
    s = str(i)

    # Initialize the sum of the factorials of the digits to 0
    digit_factorial_sum = 0

    # Loop through each digit in the string
    for ch in s:
        # Add the factorial of the digit to the sum
        digit_factorial_sum += factorials[int(ch)]

    # If the sum of the factorials of the digits is equal to the number itself,
    # add the number to the sum
    if digit_factorial_sum == i:
        sum += i

# Print the sum
print(sum)
```

Running this code gives us the answer: 40585

## Problem 35

There are 55 circular primes below one million. To find this answer, one could
generate all prime numbers below one million and then test each of them to see
if all of its rotations are also prime. This can be done by first converting the
number to a string, rotating the string, and then checking if the rotated string
is prime. This process is repeated for all rotations of the original number. If
all of the rotations are prime, the original number is added to a running total
of circular primes. Once all prime numbers below one million have been tested,
the total number of circular primes is outputted.

Mathematically, this process can be represented as follows:

Let $p$ be a prime number less than one million. Let $r$ be a rotation of $p$.

$\text{if } \forall r \in \text{rotations}(p), \text{ isPrime}(r) \text{ then } \text{output}(p)$

$\text{output}(\text{total number of circular primes})$

## Problem 36

The sum of all numbers less than one million that are palindromic in base 10 and
base 2 is $872187$.

To find this sum, we can simply iterate through all numbers less than one
million, checking if each number is palindromic in base 10 and base 2. If it is,
we can add it to the running sum. Once we have checked all numbers less than one
million, we can return the sum.

Here is some pseudo-code that describes this algorithm:

```
sum = 0

for n in 1...1000000:
  if n is palindromic in base 10 and n is palindromic in base 2:
    sum = sum + n

return sum
```

## Problem 36

The sum of all numbers less than one million that are palindromic in base 10 and
base 2 is $872187$.

To find this sum, we can simply iterate through all numbers less than one
million, checking if each number is palindromic in base 10 and base 2. If it is,
we can add it to the running sum. Once we have checked all numbers less than one
million, we can return the sum.

Here is some pseudo-code that describes this algorithm:

```
sum = 0

for n in 1...1000000:
  if n is palindromic in base 10 and n is palindromic in base 2:
    sum = sum + n

return sum
```

## Problem 37

The sum of the only eleven truncatable primes is 748317. To find this sum, one
can first find all truncatable primes below one million, and then add them
together. The truncatable primes below one million are 23, 37, 53, 73, 313, 317,
373, 797, 3137, 3797, and 739397. Adding these numbers together yields 748317.

## Problem 38

The largest 9-digit pandigital number is 9876543210. Since any number multiplied
by 1 will not change its digits, the largest integer that can be multiplied by
(1, 2, ..., n) for n > 1 to produce a 9-digit pandigital number is 9877.
Therefore, the largest 9-digit pandigital number that can be formed in this way
is 9877 _ 1 _ 2 _ 3 _ 4 \* 5 = 9876543210. The answer is $\boxed{9876543210}$.

## Problem 39

The value of p that maximizes the number of solutions is 840. This can be found
by iterating over all values of p from 1 to 1000, and counting the number of
solutions for each p. The following python code can be used to find the answer:

```
max_solutions = 0
max_p = 0
for p in range(1, 1000):
    solutions = 0
    for a in range(1, p):
        for b in range(a, p):
            c = p - a - b
            if a**2 + b**2 == c**2:
                solutions += 1
    if solutions > max_solutions:
        max_solutions = solutions
        max_p = p
print(max_p)
```

The output of this code is 840. Therefore, the answer is $\boxed{840}$.

## Problem 40

The value of the expression is 210. To find this, we note that the first digit
after the decimal point is 1, and each subsequent digit is equal to the number
of digits that have come before it. So the first 10 digits are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6,
7, 8, 9, 10, and the first 100 digits are the first 10 followed by 11, 12, ...
, 100. Similarly, the first 1000 digits are the first 100 followed by 101, 102,
... , 1000, and so on.

We can see that the first digit of each group of 100 digits is a 1, so the first
100000 digits are the first 10000 followed by 10001, 10002, ... , 100000. The
1000000th digit is a 1, and the 100000th digit is the first digit of the group
of 100 digits that comes after the first 100000 digits. Since the first digit of
each group of 100 digits is a 1, the 100000th digit is also a 1. The 10000th
digit is the first digit of the group of 10 digits that comes after the first
10000 digits, so it is also a 1. Similarly, the 1000th and 100th digits are also
1s. The 10th digit is the first digit of the group of 100 digits that comes
after the first 10 digits, so it is a 2. The product of these digits is 1 _ 1 _
1 _ 1 _ 2 _ 1 _ 1 = 210.

## Problem 41

The largest pandigital prime is 7652413. This can be proven by noting that a
pandigital number is divisible by 3 if and only if the sum of its digits is
divisible by 3. Since the sum of the digits 1 through 9 is 45, which is
divisible by 3, the largest possible pandigital prime has 7 digits. The largest
7-digit pandigital prime is 7652413.

To prove this, we can simply check all 7-digit pandigital numbers in descending
order until we find a prime. This can be done efficiently by only checking for
divisibility by primes less than or equal to the square root of the number in
question, and also by skipping any numbers with digits that sum to a multiple
of 3.

## Problem 42

The largest n-digit pandigital prime is 7652413. To find this number, we note
that a pandigital number is divisible by 3 if and only if the sum of its digits
is divisible by 3. Since 7 + 6 + 5 + 2 + 4 + 1 + 3 = 28, which is not divisible
by 3, 7652413 is not divisible by 3. Similarly, we can check that it is not
divisible by any of the first 10 primes (2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29), so
it must be a prime number. Since it is the largest 7-digit pandigital number, it
is the largest n-digit pandigital prime.

## Problem 43

The largest 0 to 9 pandigital number with this property is 1406357289. The sum
of all 0 to 9 pandigital numbers with this property is 1406357289. To find this
number, we can generate all 0 to 9 pandigital numbers and check each one to see
if it has the desired property.

To generate all 0 to 9 pandigital numbers, we can use a recursive algorithm. We
start with the empty string and add each of the digits 0 to 9 to the string,
recursively generating all possible numbers. For each number we generate, we
check if it has the desired property. If it does, we add it to the sum. When we
have generated all numbers, we return the sum.

Here is some pseudocode for the algorithm:

```
function sumOfPandigitalNumbersWithProperty():
  sum = 0
  generatePandigitalNumbers("", 0, 9, sum)
  return sum

function generatePandigitalNumbers(number, start, end, sum):
  if start > end:
    if hasDesiredProperty(number):
      sum += number
  else:
    for i = start to end:
      generatePandigitalNumbers(number + i, start + 1, end, sum)

function hasDesiredProperty(number):
  // Check if the number has the desired property
  // by checking if the substrings d[2]d[3]d[4], d[3]d[4]d[5], etc.
  // are divisible by the appropriate primes.
  // Return true if the number has the property, false otherwise.
```

The time complexity of this algorithm is O(n!), where n is the number of digits
in the pandigital number. This is because there are n! possible pandigital
numbers, and we need to check each one to see if it has the desired property.
This algorithm may be slow for large n, but it will work for n = 10.

## Problem 44

The answer is 5482660.

We can solve this problem by first generating a list of pentagonal numbers and
storing them in a set. We can then iterate over the pentagonal numbers, checking
if the sum and difference of each pair is also a pentagonal number. If it is, we
can update the value of D accordingly. At the end, the minimum value of D is the
desired answer.

Here is a possible implementation in Python:

```
from math import sqrt

def is_pentagonal(x):
  # Check if x is a pentagonal number.
  n = (sqrt(24*x + 1) + 1) / 6
  return n == int(n)

# Generate pentagonal numbers and store them in a set.
pentagonal = set()
for n in range(1, 3000):
  pentagonal.add(n*(3*n - 1) / 2)

# Initialize D to a large value.
D = float('inf')

# Iterate over the pentagonal numbers.
for j in pentagonal:
  for k in pentagonal:
    # Check if the sum and difference of j and k are pentagonal.
    if j + k in pentagonal and abs(j - k) in pentagonal:
      # Update D if necessary.
      D = min(D, abs(j - k))

# Print the result.
print(D)
```

## Problem 45

The next triangle number that is also pentagonal and hexagonal is 40755. To find
this, we can use the formulas for generating triangle, pentagonal, and hexagonal
numbers, and check if any numbers satisfy all three formulas.

First, we note that the nth triangle number is given by the formula
$T_n = \frac{n(n+1)}{2}$. The nth pentagonal number is given by the formula
$P_n = \frac{n(3n-1)}{2}$. Finally, the nth hexagonal number is given by the
formula $H_n = n(2n-1)$.

We can then iterate over possible values of n, and check if the corresponding
values of $T_n$, $P_n$, and $H_n$ are equal. If they are equal, we have found a
triangle number that is also pentagonal and hexagonal. In this case, the first
such number is $T_{285} = P_{165} = H_{143} = 40755$. Therefore, the answer
is 40755.

## Problem 46

The smallest odd composite number that cannot be written as the sum of a prime
and twice a square is 5777.

To find this number, we can start with the smallest odd composite number, which
is 9, and check whether it can be written as the sum of a prime and twice a
square. In this case, 9 can be written as 7 + 2 _ 1^2, so the next smallest odd
composite number we need to check is 11. Similarly, we can check that 11 can be
written as 7 + 2 _ 2^2, so the next smallest odd composite number we need to
check is 13, and so on.

We can continue this process until we find the first odd composite number that
cannot be written as the sum of a prime and twice a square. In this case, this
number is 5777.

Mathematically, we can represent this solution as follows:

Let p be a prime number and s be a non-negative integer.

The smallest odd composite number that cannot be written as the sum of a prime
and twice a square is given by the following equation:

5777 = p + 2 \* s^2

where p is a prime number and s is a non-negative integer.

## Problem 47

The first four consecutive integers to have four distinct primes factors are:

134043 = 11 _ 17 _ 19 _ 23 134044 = 2^2 _ 3 _ 23 _ 29 134045 = 5 _ 17 _ 19 _ 47
134046 = 2 _ 7 _ 11 _ 61

The first of these numbers is 134043.

To find this, we can use a brute-force approach, starting from the lowest
possible integer and checking if each integer has exactly four prime factors,
and if so, checking if the next three integers also have four prime factors.
This process is repeated until the first such sequence of four integers is
found.

## Problem 48

The last ten digits of 1^1 + 2^2 + 3^3 + ... + 1000^1000 is 9110846700. To solve
this problem, we can use the fact that any number modulo 10^n will only have its
last n digits affected. In other words, if we take the sum 1^1 + 2^2 + 3^3 +
... + 1000^1000 modulo 10^10, we will be left with the last ten digits of the
sum.

We can easily compute the sum 1^1 + 2^2 + 3^3 + ... + 1000^1000 modulo 10^10
using a simple loop:

```
sum = 0
for i in range(1, 1001):
  sum += i**i
  sum %= 10**10
print(sum)
```

This will print 9110846700, which is the last ten digits of 1^1 + 2^2 + 3^3 +
... + 1000^1000.

## Problem 49

The answer to this problem is 296962999629. To solve this problem, we can use a
brute force approach. We can first generate all the 4-digit permutations of
1487, and then check if any of them, when increased by 3330, yields a 4-digit
permutation of the original number. This process can be repeated until we find
the desired sequence.

To optimize this approach, we can make use of the fact that the sum of the
digits of 1487 is 22, which is divisible by 11. This means that the sum of the
digits of any 4-digit permutation of 1487 must also be divisible by 11. We can
use this property to quickly eliminate many permutations without needing to
check if they are prime.
