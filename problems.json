The Duchy of Grand Fenwick\n[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Fenwick], has a tighter budget,\nand has asked you (their Royal Programmer) to compute what shape would\nget best maximum enclosed-area/wall-length ratio.\n\nYou have done some preliminary calculations on a sheet of paper. For a\n2000 meter wall enclosing the 250 000 m^2 area the enclosed-area /\nwall-length ratio is 125.\n\nAlthough not allowed, but to get an idea if this is anything better: if\nyou place a circle inside the square area touching the four sides the area\nwill be equal to \u03c0*250^2 m^2 and the perimeter will be \u03c0*500 m, so the\nenclosed-area/wall-length ratio will also be 125.\n\nHowever, if you cut off from the square four triangles with sides 75 m, 75\nm and 75\u221a2 m the total area becomes 238750 m^2 and the perimeter becomes\n1400+300\u221a2 m. So this gives an enclosed-area/wall-length ratio of 130.87,\nwhich is significantly better.\n\n[Image: 314_landgrab.gif]\n\nFind the maximum enclosed-area/wall-length ratio.

  "315": "[Image: 315_clocks.gif]\n\nSam and Max are asked to transform two digital clocks into two \"digital\nroot\" clocks. A digital root clock is a digital clock that calculates\ndigital roots step by step.\n\nWhen a clock is fed a number, it will show it and then it will start the\ncalculation, showing all the intermediate values until it gets to the\nresult. For example, if the clock is fed the number 137, it will show:\n\"137\" \u2192 \"11\" \u2192 \"2\" and then it will go black, waiting for the next number.\n\nEvery digital number consists of some light segments: three horizontal\n(top, middle, bottom) and four vertical (top-left, top-right, bottom-left,\nbottom-right). Number \"1\" is made of vertical top-right and bottom-right,\nnumber \"4\" is made by middle horizontal and vertical top-left, top-right\nand bottom-right. Number \"8\" lights them all.\n\nThe clocks consume energy only when segments are turned on/off. To turn on\na \"2\" will cost 5 transitions, while a \"7\" will cost only 4 transitions.\n\nSam and Max built two different clocks.\n\nSam's clock is fed e.g. number 137: the clock shows \"137\", then the panel\nis turned off, then the next number (\"11\") is turned on, then the panel is\nturned off again and finally the last number (\"2\") is turned on and, after\nsome time, off.\nFor the example, with number 137, Sam's clock requires:\n\n\"137\" : (2 + 5 + 4) \u00d7 2 = 22 transitions (\"137\" on/off).\n\"11\"  : (2 + 2) \u00d7 2 = 8 transitions (\"11\" on/off).\n\"2\"   : (5) \u00d7 2 = 10 transitions (\"2\" on/off).\n\nFor a grand total of 40 transitions.\n\nMax's clock works differently. Instead of turning off the whole panel, it\nis smart enough to turn off only those segments that won't be needed for\nthe next number.\nFor number 137, Max's clock requires:\n\n       2 + 5 + 4 = 11 transitions (\"137\" on)\n\"137\" : 7 transitions (to turn off the segments that are not needed for\n       number \"11\").\n       0 transitions (number \"11\" is already turned on correctly)\n\"11\"  : 3 transitions (to turn off the first \"1\" and the bottom part of\n       the second \"1\";\n       the top part is common with number \"2\").\n       4 tansitions (to turn on the remaining segments in order to get a\n\"2\"   : \"2\")\n       5 transitions (to turn off number \"2\").\n\nFor a grand total of 30 transitions.\n\nOf course, Max's clock consumes less power than Sam's one. The two clocks\nare fed all the prime numbers between A = 10^7 and B = 2\u00d710^7.\n\nFind the difference between the total number of transitions needed by\nSam's clock and that needed by Max's one.\n",
